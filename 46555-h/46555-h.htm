  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br /><b>THE LIBRARY MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >The forerunner of the American public library of today
is found in the subscription or stock company libraries
of Philadelphia, Boston and other cities. The oldest of
these is the Philadelphia Library Company, founded in
1731 by Benjamin Franklin who later referred to it as
“the mother of all subscription libraries in America.”
The Rev. Jacob Duché, a director of the Library Company,
wrote in 1774: “Literary accomplishments here meet with
deserved applause. But such is the taste for books that
almost every man is a reader.” The Library Company’s
authority on book selection was James Logan (the friend
of William Penn) who was esteemed “to be a gentleman
of universal learning and the best judge of books in these
parts.” In 1783 the Library Committee instructed its
London agent that “though not averse to mingling the
dulce with the utile, they did not care to have him buy
any more novels.”</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1869 the Library Company was made the beneficiary
under the will of Dr. James Rush, who left $1,500,000 to
establish the Ridgeway Branch. On account of the conditions
attached to the bequest, the gift was accepted by a
bare majority of the stockholders. Among other restrictions,
the will contained the following clause: “Let the
library not keep cushioned seats for time-wasting and
lounging readers, nor places for every-day novels, mind-tainting
reviews, controversial politics, scribblings of poetry
and prose, biographies of unknown names, nor for those
teachers of disjointed thinking, the daily newspapers.”
The provisions of the will were strictly carried out and
today the Ridgeway Library stands as a storehouse of the
literature of the past, a monument to the donor and an
evidence of the change that has come over the world in
its conception of the function of the library.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
<b>Boston Athenæum.</b>—Like the Philadelphia Library Company,
the Boston Athenæum was the outgrowth of a group
of men who had in common an interest in books. In May
1806, the Anthology Society, which had been editing the
“Monthly Anthology and Boston review,” established a
reading room, the object of which was to afford subscribers
a meeting place furnished with the principal American
and European periodicals. The annual subscription was
placed at ten dollars, which was not more than the cost
of a single daily paper. The organization prospered and
by 1827 the treasurer’s books showed property valued at
more than $100,000. Two years later the library administration
faced a new problem: a woman applied for admission
to the library. Having no precedent to guide him,
the librarian allowed the applicant free access to the shelves.
She was Hannah Adams, who wrote “A view of religious
opinions,” a “History of New England,” and “The history
of the Jews.” The next woman to ask for admission to
the treasures of the Athenæum was Mrs. Lydia Maria
Child, (1802-1880), author of “The rebels,” “The freedman’s
books,” “Hobomok,” etc., but her ticket of admission was
shortly revoked “lest the privilege cause future embarrassment.”
As late as 1855 Charles Folsom entered a protest
against women having access to “the corrupter portions
of polite literature.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Boston Public Library.</b>—In 1825 a plan was proposed
whereby all the libraries in Boston should be united under
one roof. Later, a Frenchman by name of Vattemare,
caused to be introduced into Congress a measure which was
to build up great libraries through international exchanges.
A public meeting was held in Boston but a committee of
the Boston Athenæum opposed the scheme and it was
dropped. However, in return for some books forwarded
through Vattemare to the Municipal Council of Paris, the
Mayor of Boston received in 1843 about fifty volumes,
which in reality formed the nucleus of the Boston Public
Library.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1847 the Boston City Council appointed a joint committee
on a library. The next year a special act was passed
by the Massachusetts State Legislature authorizing the
city of Boston to found and maintain a library. Efforts
were made to effect a union of interests with the Boston
Athenæum, but they failed. In 1849 the first books were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
presented by the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, and in the
following year J. P. Bigelow, then Mayor of the city, turned
over to a library fund the sum of $1,000 which had been
presented to him as a personal testimony. Edward Everett
presented 1,000 United States documents, and Edward
Capen was appointed librarian by the Mayor. George
Ticknor, a member of the Board, helped to draw up a
preliminary report outlining the ideals for the new civic
institution. The library was not to be a “mere resort of
professed scholars.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The key note of the whole public library movement in
America was struck by Ticknor when in 1851 he wrote of
his hopes for the new library proposed for Boston: “I
would establish a library which differs from all free libraries
yet attempted; I mean one in which any popular books,
tending to moral and intellectual improvement, shall be furnished
in such numbers of copies that many persons can
be reading the same book at the same time; in short, that
not only the best books of all sorts, but the pleasant literature
of the day, shall be made accessible to the whole people
when they most care for it, that is, when it is fresh and new.”</p>

<p class='c010' >A timely friend was found in Joshua Bates, who gave
more than $50,000 for the purchase of books, saying that
he thought it was desirable to render the public library
at once as useful as possible by providing it with a large
collection of books in many departments of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010' >Thus the aim of the founders was quickly realized, it
having been their professed intention to make the library
what no other library in the world had either attempted
or desired to become, “a powerful and direct means for
the intellectual and moral advancement of a whole people
without distinction of class or condition.” The Boston
Public Library was the pioneer of the large public libraries
in America and as such has long enjoyed a prominence
which in a way has resulted in its differentiation from
other large municipal institutions.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Astor Library.</b>—John Jacob Astor, who came to this
country in 1783, as a young man of 20, independent
of capital, family connections or influence, became the
richest man of his day in the United States, and wished to
show his feelings of gratitude towards the city of New
York, in which he had lived so long and prospered. When
he consulted with his friends, Fitz Green Halleck and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
Washington Irving among others, as to the object to which
his liberality should be applied, the plan of building a
public library was the most approved and a decision was
promptly made in favor of it. Four hundred thousand
dollars was left for this purpose. The site chosen for the
new Astor Library was in Lafayette Place, in which street
lived Mr. William B. Astor, a son of the donor. Washington
Irving was the first president of the Board of Trustees, and
Joseph G. Cogswell was the first librarian. According to
John Hill Burton in the “Book hunter,” Mr. Cogswell
“spent some years in Europe with Mr. Astor’s princely
endowment in his pocket, and showed himself a judicious,
active and formidable sportsman in the book-hunting
world. Whenever from private collections or the breaking
up of public institutions, rarities got abroad in the open
market, the collectors of the old world found that they
had a resolute competitor to deal with, almost, it might
be said, a desperate one, since he was, in a manner, the
representative of a nation using powerful efforts to get
a share of the library treasures of the old world. I know
that in the instance of the Astor Library the selections
of the books have been made with great judgment and
that after the boundaries of the common crowded markets
were passed and individual rarities had to be stalked in
distant hunting grounds, innate literary value was still
held as an object more important than mere abstract rarity,
and, as the more worthy quality of the two, that on which
the buying power available to the emissary was brought
to bear.” Cogswell was essentially a bibliophile. He
loved books “with an eager and grasping love,” said Donald
G. Mitchell. To his fruitful labor was due the splendid
growth of the Astor collections. Cogswell presented to
the Library his own collection of bibliographical literature,
and gave the institution a reputation for wealth in this
field. “So well has the impress thus imparted been maintained,”
said Dr. Richard Garnett, “that the Astor Library
is said to contain hardly any light and frivolous books.”
Both the son and grandson of the founder, as well as other
members of the Astor family, added generously to the
wealth of the institution so that today the total endowment
is estimated at over two million dollars. With its increase
in resources came an increase in its use. “I range daily
in the alcoves of the Astor, more charming than the gardens
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
of Boccaccio, and each hour a Decameron,” wrote Charles
Sumner to Theodore Parker. Among the constant users
was Horace Greeley, who had a special table reserved for
himself.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Lenox Library.</b>—James Lenox, a shy recluse, a bachelor,
born to a wealthy inheritance, found his chief joy in the
collecting of books, manuscripts, and objets d’art. He first
collected early editions of the Bible in all languages; then
Americana, including the original editions of the works
of the great travelers and discoverers. John Bunyan and
Milton received much attention from Mr. Lenox, and he
succeeded in garnering a vast array of editions of those
two authors. “This mode of collecting has certainly its
advantages,” said Henry Stevens, “but it can hardly be
denied that it is attended with serious disadvantages. The
result of all Mr. Lenox’s enormous study and labor, to
say nothing of his vast expenditures, it must be confessed,
is a patchy library as he left it. His favorite subjects and
authors he rendered astonishingly rich, but the subjects
and authors he neglected at the same time are also astonishingly
numerous.” In 1870 Mr. Lenox presented the collection
to the city of New York, together with a block on Fifth
Avenue and a sufficient fund to erect a library building.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Tilden Bequest.</b>—Samuel J. Tilden was not, according
to his biographer, John Bigelow, a book collector in the
ordinary sense of the term. “Mr. Tilden had a very fastidious
taste for books, which he indulged without much
regard to expense. He bought books for his immediate
use and enjoyment, and apparently with no thought of
collecting a library that should be complete in any department.”
For the purpose of establishing and maintaining
a free library and reading room in the city of New York
he established the “Tilden Trust,” to which he bequeathed
the sum of nearly four million dollars. By long litigation
it was reduced about one-half. The trustees were anxious
to apply this fund in a way that should prove most advantageous
to the people of New York City and at the same
time strictly conform to the wishes of the testator. The
endowment was accordingly offered to the Municipal
Building Committee of the city in 1893, to be devoted to
the construction of a public library in a new City Hall,
at that time planned for Bryant Park. This plan had to
be given up the next year when the act authorizing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
removal of the old City Hall was repealed, but the expectations
of the testator were carried out later by merging
the Tilden Trust with the Astor and Lenox bequests into
one grand “New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and
Tilden Foundations.” This consolidation was effected on
May 23, 1895, when the Board of Trustees, composed of
seven members from each of the three foundations, proceeded
to plan the organization of a comprehensive library
system. An appeal to the municipal authorities was made
in 1896 stating that if the city would furnish a proper site
and provide the money to locate thereon a building suitable
for the purposes of the New York Public Library,
then the library through the sale of its present sites, could
obtain such an addition to its funds as would justify it in
providing for the circulation of the books from this main
building. The result was that the library was granted
the old reservoir ground on Fifth Avenue, between 40th and
42nd Streets, and the trustees were enabled to begin planning
for the erection of the splendid fireproof structure, eventually
opened to the public in 1911.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>New York Public Library.</b>—The union of these three
corporations to form a single library worthy of the great
American metropolis was very justly characterized by Lawrence
Hutton as “one of the most important events in the
whole history of the Island of Manhattan.” New York
had long labored under the disadvantage of having no
public library from which books could be freely borrowed
by her citizens. Dr. Cogswell once remarked that a free
circulating library in New York was impossible and that
in five years any collection of books made for that purpose
would be scattered forever beyond hope of recovery. He
here showed the distrust of the book-collector and the
attitude of the old style librarian towards the books entrusted
to his care.</p>

<p class='c010' >The Astor and the Lenox Libraries were for reference
use only, and were never open in the evenings or on holidays.
Through the great generosity of Andrew Carnegie the
New York Public Library is able to operate an extensive
series of branches, primarily intended for the purposes
of circulating books in the surrounding neighborhoods.
“The main purpose of the library is educational,” said
the late Dr. J. S. Billings. “It is also to furnish the means
of recreation and amusement to large numbers of readers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
A great library like this must be omniverous. It must
have rare and costly books, indispensable to scholars, and
also the ephemeral pamphlets of the day which have no
commercial value when they appear but eventually become
historical documents. The library should be an encyclopedia
always kept up to date.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>The Spread of Public Libraries.</b>—From the above sketches
some idea can be gained as to how recent is the development
of the library into the tax-supported institution we know
to-day. The last generation has witnessed the spread of
the public library movement westward at such a rate that
many of the most striking illustrations of the usefulness
of the modern library are to be gathered from the newer
libraries of the western states. Within the last two decades
the public library has gained strong allies in such new
organizations as state library commissions, inter-state
library associations, and library training schools. The
library schools have inculcated into their students the
body of America’s library doctrine which has grown up
with the movement in this country. The association
meetings have been helpful in providing for the discussion
of mooted topics and giving librarianship a unity which
it could not otherwise have gained.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>American Library Association.</b>—Organized in 1876 to
promote the welfare of libraries; it had the <i>Library
Journal</i> as its official organ for many years, but now
publishes its own Bulletin containing announcements and
proceedings of the annual meeting. The Association aims
to effect needed legislation and reforms which could not
be brought about by individual effort; to improve library
administration and lessen the labor and expense of it; to
utilize the combined experience of the profession, to promote
esprit de corps among library workers and to advance the
common interests of trustees, librarians and assistants.
Various sections have been organized: the college and
reference section, catalog section, trustees’ section, library
work with children and state library commissions. It has
a publishing board of five members, appointed by the
executive board, the aim of which is to secure and prepare
publications, catalogs, indexes and other bibliographic and
library aids. The publications are a great help to libraries
and references are made to a number of them throughout
this manual. The headquarters of the Association are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
located on the upper floor of the Chicago Public Library.
Address: 78 E. Washington St.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>State Library Commissions.</b>—Commissions have been
established in thirty-three states with the view of advancing
the library interests of the state. They aim not only to
promote the efficiency of the libraries already existing but
also to help in the establishing of new ones. They collect
statistics of libraries throughout the state and so are able
to help the backward ones by showing what is being done
in the more active communities. Some commissions conduct
summer library schools where the untrained assistants
from the smaller libraries can get valuable instruction.
Others have institutes and district meetings at which topics
of interest to the smaller libraries are discussed. Organizers
are sent to such libraries as are in need of reorganization,
recataloging or professional help along one line or another.
In some states the commission takes charge of the traveling
libraries, which are sent to clubs, granges and the smaller
libraries. The sending of books to the blind falls within
the province of the library commissions in certain states.
Some are authorized to give direct financial aid to the
smaller struggling libraries. Nearly all the commissions
publish bulletins, circulars of information, library laws,
selected lists of helpful books, and occasional leaflets.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Traveling Libraries.</b>—In order to carry the advantages
of the public library system to the residents of rural districts
and villages, a system of traveling libraries has been introduced
into most of the states. New York was the first
to adopt this system, which it did in 1892 at the instance
of Melvil Dewey, then State Librarian. The plan was
to send a number of small libraries, each containing one
hundred carefully selected volumes, which were lent for
six months at a time to “stations” from which requests
had been received. In 1895 Michigan and Iowa introduced
the system as a part of the work of their state libraries
and in the following year a traveling library system for
one county was established through private generosity.
The Wisconsin Free Library Commission soon took it up
and developed it for the whole state. In some states where
the traveling libraries have not been fostered by state aid,
the work has been carried on by the women’s clubs, as
for example in Colorado.</p>

<p class='c010' >In Michigan application for traveling libraries can be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
made by study clubs, Epworth leagues, Y. M. C. A. and
Y. W. C. A., Sunday schools, farmers’ clubs, granges,
reading circles, etc. The titles are selected from printed
finding lists, and the books go by freight at the expense
of the borrower. If books on a special topic are desired,
the request should be filed by May 1st with the State Librarian
in order to receive them in the fall. The State
Library has also a loan collection of pictures, reproductions
of the best examples of ancient and modern art. The
unframed pictures are loaned to art clubs, while the framed
ones are loaned to schools to be kept on their walls from
three to six months.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><b>ORGANIZATION OF A LIBRARY.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >The organization of the average library consists of the
following component parts:</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>1. Board of Trustees.</b>—The main function of the board
of trustees is to look after the financial interests of the
library, to see that the buildings and equipment are properly
cared for, and to decide broad questions of policy. Trustees
should be (but are not always) elected from the elite of the
community. It is expected that in them will be found a
genuine culture, an appreciation of things pertaining to the
arts and sciences, combined with the advantages of education,
travel and sufficient leisure to look after public interests.
“Cultivated men,” says Edward Edwards, “familiar
with books from childhood, have usually a very inadequate
perception of the toil and thought which have to be given
to the good arrangement, the accurate cataloging, and the
ready service of a library. What, then, is to be expected
if a dominant share in the management of a library be
placed in the hands of men with just enough of elementary
education to bring into broad daylight the intensest ignorance,
in union with the most stolid self-conceit?” “A little
bookishness in a committeeman,” said Justin Winsor,
“may be as dangerous as a sip from the poet’s Pierian spring,
particularly if there is no deeper learning in any of his
associates. He knows just enough of books not to know
that he knows nothing of libraries.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>2. The Librarian.</b>—“A librarian,” said Henry Bradshaw,
“is one who earns his living by attending to the wants of
those for whose use the library under his charge exists,
his prime duty being, in the widest possible sense of the
phrase, to save the time of those who seek his services.”
The librarian has been variously compared to the commissariat
in the republic of letters, whose business is not to
fight himself but to put others in fighting trim,—or to
the host at the banquet of knowledge who is assiduous in
securing the comfort of the guests and in placing before
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
each one just the kind of food he likes and requires. He
knows that what is one man’s meat is another man’s poison.
Enthusiasm for the work is a prime requisite in the librarian.
Even a good staff cannot overcome the deadening influence
of daily contact with a chief lacking in enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010' >To the librarian should be left the details of administration.
The librarian is the executive officer of the board of
trustees and the latter, if wise, will look to the librarian
for getting the results desired and will allow that officer
as free a hand as possible. If the librarian is not capable
of administering the library, or worthy of the fullest confidence,
the sooner one is secured who measures up to this
standard the better.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>3. The Library Staff.</b>—The duties of the staff vary
with the size of the library. In the smallest libraries the
librarian may be the only one engaged in the actual work
of the library, but in such cases the library hours must be
restricted to such as one person can take care of. The next
step in growth is to have some one relieve the librarian at
the desk and to do the more clerical work. Next come
special assistants to look after special tasks like cataloging
and classifying, desk work and so on. The staff, whether
large or small, should consider itself responsible to the
librarian and should not, except in extraordinary cases,
go directly to the board of trustees with petitions. The
librarian should always be the spokesman for the staff.
Going over his head indicates a lack of sympathy and
cooperation between the librarian and staff that argues
badly for the welfare of the institution.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Qualifications for Library Work.</b>—The best preparation
for library work is a thorough, systematic general education.
To this should be added a special preparation secured
either through apprenticeship, a training class, or a regular
library school. Different positions call for different qualities
in assistants but library service in general demands tact,
perseverance, adaptability, habits of precision and accuracy,
with a fair amount of speed, ability to distinguish
between essentials and non-essentials, and a strong desire
to be of service. A certain familiarity with books and
famous characters in history and in fiction is expected of
every one in a library. Personal neatness, good temper,
and a sense of humor are valuable assets in this as in other
lines of work. No one will succeed in library work who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
goes into it merely for the money that can be got out of it.</p>

<p class='c010' >Loyalty to the institution and its officers is essential to
efficient service. If the assistant cannot feel this sense of
loyalty, the sooner a new position is secured, the better
for all concerned.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dignity, self-possession, and self-reliance are valuable
qualities in any part of the library, but are especially needed
by assistants at the reference desk.</p>

<p class='c010' >Qualities that unfit one for library work in general are
physical weakness, deformity, poor memory, a discontented
disposition, egotism, a lack of system in one’s method of
work, and inability or unwillingness to take responsibilities,
a tendency to theorize, criticise, or gossip, inability to mind
one’s own business, fussiness, and long-windedness.</p>

<p class='c010' >One librarian advocates listing the virtues and personal
qualities of the staff and apprentices by having a questionnaire
like the following filled out for each assistant:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'   >

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, gives the
following advice to aspirants for library positions:</p>

<p class='c010' >“First, secure the best possible general education, including,
if possible, a college course or its equivalent; second,
acquire a reading knowledge of at least French and German;
third, add to this a training in a library school; fourth, if
a choice must be made between the special training in a
library school and a general course in a college, choose the
general course, but make every effort to supplement this
by the special course if only for a brief period; fifth, if an
opportunity occur for foreign travel, utilize it; sixth, if you
have not been able to contrive either a thorough general
education or special training, your best opportunities in
library work will be in a small library where your personal
characteristics may be such as to offset these other deficiencies;
seventh, without at least a fair reading knowledge of
French and German you cannot progress beyond the most
subordinate positions in a large library.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><b>BOOK SELECTION AND BUYING.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' ><b>Book Selection.</b>—Book selection makes the greatest demand
on the knowledge and administrative judgment of
librarians and is the question that produces the most friction
between librarians and library committees. If the trustees
define the general policy of the library, determine the amount
to be expended on books, and approve purchases out of the
ordinary run, the librarian should be considered as the one
person best posted on the needs of the library, and as purchasing
agent for the institution should be allowed to buy
where he can do so to the best advantage. Of course, the
problem is quite different in an academic library from what
it is in a public library. Especially in the latter should
the librarian be granted the utmost freedom in the selection
of the general run of books.</p>

<p class='c010' >“We are often asked who selects the books for purchase
and how this is done,” says Dr. A. E. Bostwick in the
annual report of the St. Louis Public Library for 1911-12.
“About 10,000 volumes are issued from American presses
yearly, not to mention those of England and other European
countries. Of these we can purchase only about 2,000
titles. Of the remainder some are eliminated by their
heavy cost, as in the case of <b>editions de luxe</b> and most
works intended for wealthy collectors; some because of
their class, such as technical works on law and medicine,
which we are leaving to the special local libraries devoted
to these subjects; and some because they are obviously
below standard, being either untrustworthy, trivial or
objectionable. There remains a very considerable number,
any one of which we might purchase but only a certain
proportion of which we can buy with the funds at our
disposal. From these we try to select the best, judging
from the standpoint of a high-grade public library. Some
of the considerations that affect our decision are, first, public
demand, to which we always give heed unless it is obviously
uninformed; secondly, a desire to strengthen our collection
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
in weak points; and thirdly, expert advice, oral or printed,
volunteered or specially asked. Here in St. Louis, we are
profiting by the services of numerous experts in special
subjects, which are freely given as a public service, and
we scan carefully every bit of expert testimony regarding
the availability of books contained in the bulletins of other
libraries and in other current lists and bibliographies.
Trade lists and catalogues of all kinds are checked up with
our own to see what we lack, and the result is the assemblage
of a list of wants far larger than we can purchase. The
final selection from these is apt to leave behind some things
that we ought to buy, but it is unlikely to include anything
that could well have been left out, considering our special
conditions and needs. The final word in selection rests
with a committee of the Board; but for ordinary current
purchases, and unless some point involving the larger policies
of selection is to be settled, this committee usually allows
the librarian to exercise his own judgment. Besides the
sources of selection already mentioned, books on approval
are received in considerable quantities, sometimes being
sent voluntarily by dealers or individuals, sometimes requested
by the library.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The librarian must develop a sense of proportion and
beware of the library patron with a hobby, and of the
trustee who is interested in building up only one side of
the library, and of the scholar who thinks that “only solid
reading for the immortal mind should be placed before
old and young.” In buying for an average public library
the aim should be to choose general treatises rather than
those covering only special phases or special subjects. The
special treatises would be the more desirable for a university
library, where they would be in demand both by faculty
and students, as authorities on detailed points, as aids or
as sources in further investigation.</p>

<p class='c010' >Too much money should not be locked up in expensive
volumes that will be seldom used. The librarian should
estimate the average cost of his books per volume and,
except in the case of reference books, should not go too
far beyond this average cost. He should avoid partisanship
and develop catholicity of taste and breadth of sympathy.
He should try to have something on his shelves
for every patron in town, real or potential, but should not
allow the library to be drawn into any sectarian propagandist
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
movement. He should avoid controversial works, sensationalism
and the latest fad, and put off the purchase of the
book of the hour until he feels fairly sure that the demand
for it will not die within the hour.</p>

<p class='c010' >The efficient librarian does not think too much of the
sum total of accessions, but is mindful of the fact that it is
quality not quantity that counts. “It doesn’t matter how
many but how good books you have.” This was said by
Seneca, but the same truth has been stated by many modern
librarians. “I should as soon tell how many tons the books
in the Astor Library weigh as to tell how many volumes there
are,” was a sage remark of Dr. Joseph G. Cogswell. “Strength
does not lie in mere numbers; this fact is as true of books
as of soldiers,” said Mr. W. E. Foster. “One thousand
carefully picked are worth two thousand assembled at
random.”</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Aids in Book Selection.</b>—The chief aid in book selection
for the average small public library is the A. L. A. catalog.
The first edition was issued in 1893 for the World’s Columbian
Exposition. It was planned as a guide for book
buyers as well as for readers and as a manual for librarians
in the matter of book selection. To a certain extent it
was hoped that it would take the place of a printed catalog
in some of the smaller public libraries. By checking in the
margin the titles of the books owned it forms a convenient
partial catalog of best books for any library. In 1904 a
classified and annotated edition, thoroughly revised and
brought down to date, was prepared for the St. Louis Exposition.
This included 7,520 volumes adapted to public
libraries as contrasted with 5,000 titles included in the earlier
edition. A supplementary class list of 3,000 titles, covering
the books issued between 1904 and 1911, was issued by
the A. L. A. in 1912. The “A. L. A. Booklist,” a guide to
the best new books, has just completed its ninth annual,
volume.</p>

<p class='c010' >Various state library commissions have issued helpful
lists. Wisconsin’s “Suggestive list of books for a small
library” is a good specimen. The “Fiction catalog” published
by H. W. Wilson Co., Minneapolis, is useful as a check
list and contains many excellent titles. In the same way
the lists of the 100 and of the 1000 best novels issued by
the Free Library of Newark, N. J., are worth studying.
Various lists of best books, like Sir John Lubbock’s famous
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
“hundred best books,” or Dr. Eliot’s “five foot library,”
are to be found in a pamphlet “The World’s best books,”
which is to be had free of charge from the Globe Wernicke
Co., Cincinnati.</p>

<p class='c010' >For additional titles see “Aids in book selection” by
Alice B. Kroeger and Sarah W. Cattell (A. L. A. Publishing
board, 1908.)</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Bookbuying.</b>—If it is desired to buy a special list of
books, already selected, it is usually best to place the order
with one of the large houses which make a specialty of
library trade or with a local dealer, if the proper service and
discounts are assured. Cost of carriage may total up high
enough to offset a special discount, and so should be considered
in comparing prices offered by two different dealers.
In scanning a list of books to be bought, attention should
be paid to</p>
<p class='c012' >1. Those titles which are to be had in reinforced bindings.</p>

<p class='c012' >2. Titles which are to be had in special editions, as in
Everyman’s Library.</p>

<p class='c012' >3. Titles which are to be had from dealers in remainders
and are likely to be offered at bargain prices.</p>

<p class='c010' >The “List of editions selected for economy in book buying,”
compiled by Leroy Jeffers, and published by the
American Library Association (25 cts.) is well worth studying.</p>

<p class='c010' >The selection of books to be bought at any one time
will be determined by the prices at which they can be
secured and consequently it is desirable to constantly study
dealers’ catalogs. Worn copies of popular titles or copies
that are loose in their bindings are not ordinarily wise
purchases, as they soon require rebinding, and thus make
the total cost exceed the first cost of a copy in reinforced
binding.</p>

<p class='c010' >Subscription books are rarely worth anything like the
money asked for them. If wanted they can frequently
be bought from dealers in second hand books, or from
jobbers in remainders and surplus stock.</p>

<p class='c010' >Books should not be bought from traveling agents. There
are only a few publishing houses who employ them who
would not supply their books through the regular channels
of trade. “Editions de luxe” are now generally understood
to be for looks only, and “library editions” are frequently
so called because they are for the private and not for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
public library, being put up in a way not warranted to
withstand wear and tear.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Accession Book.</b>—The accession book, which corresponds
to the invoice book of a business house, is the first of all records
to be made of a book after it has been acquired by a library.
The accession book aims to show the additions of
each day in the exact order of their reception, without classification
of any kind. One turns to it to learn what price
was paid for a book, when and where it was bought, how
much was paid for binding it, if it was bound after being
acquired by the library, how much was paid for replacement
if lost, etc. Each volume is entered on a separate line, and
secures a separate accession number. By means of this
number the history of any particular book can be traced.
The accession book is the most permanent of the library
records; entries cannot disappear as from a card shelf list,
and it is of the greatest value in case of books lost or destroyed
by fire. Each book should be entered immediately
after it is collated and found to agree with the order and
bill. The entries must be kept up to date in order to avoid
loss and confusion. An accession number should be given
each separate volume. Giving a single accession number
to a set leads to endless confusion. A numbering machine
will save time and help to prevent errors.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><b>CLASSIFICATION.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' ><b>Definition.</b>—Classification consists of putting like things
together. We do this every day, and the classification of
books is only one special phase of this general process.
Thus, a man who owns a hardware store does not place
his goods helter skelter,—a stove, a box of nails, some saws
and then a furnace, but he runs over his stock and classifies
it, putting stoves in one place, nails in another. By this
classification he gains two things: first, he can find any
one thing he wants more quickly; secondly, he can tell
how much of any one article he has on hand and so decide
whether he must lay in a new supply. Likewise, the zoologist
classifies all members of the animal kingdom, so that
he can learn what the different kinds of animals are and
study the relationship between them. Without the help
afforded by classification he would be overwhelmed by
the immense number of facts brought before him and
without the aid of classification he would never have known
of evolution, the guiding star of modern investigation.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>First Principles.</b>—In our every-day life we lose much
time hunting for things for which we have no definite place.
We have put them in the place which was most convenient
for us at the moment when we put them away. Think for
yourself how it is with your knowledge. From observation,
from conversation, from reading, you learn a little about
many subjects like electricity, botany, astronomy or politics,
but in this desultory way you do not learn very much about
any one of these subjects. Therefore you do not feel any
special need of classifying your information, but when you
take up any of these subjects and pursue it seriously you
learn thousands of facts and relations, and then is the
time that you feel the need of some plan of arrangement of
your knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Private vs. Institutional Libraries.</b>—One has the same
experience in regard to books. A person having a library
of from fifty to three hundred books does not feel the need of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
classifying them. The ordinary arrangement is based upon
size, color or convenience. The books in the average house
are so placed as to look their best. The classification, as
far as it exists, is an esthetic one. The owner knows the
exact appearance of every volume in his library and when
he wants Longfellow’s poems he can tell at a glance where
it is. In a small private library there is no occasion for
all the history being in one place or all the poems in another.
As the library grows, the esthetic principle of classification
can be followed until the owner can no longer readily remember
how each book looks.</p>

<p class='c010' >But our institutional libraries contain so many books
that the librarian cannot know them in the same way that
he can the books in his own private library and consequently
he has to study the question of classification and devise
a method by which not only he, but his assistants and
also such readers as have access to the books, can readily
find them as wanted. Classification, the putting of like
things together, would, therefore, mean in a large library,
putting histories together in one place, the medical books
together in another place, and so with all other distinctive
subjects. Each of these large classes will, however, have
to be subdivided. Thus, histories of Greece are put together
in one place, histories of Rome in another, histories
of the United States in still another. The subdivision
in the larger libraries is carried still farther and books on
the period of the discovery of America are put first, followed
by books on the Colonial period of the United States, the
Revolutionary War, etc. United States history, if well
represented, is classified geographically. This process of
subdivision into separate groups of books on each state can
be carried still farther if necessary.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Advantages of Classification.</b>—The following questions
may arise: What advantages come from the classification,
and who are benefited? The advantages come to those
having access to the books. If one goes to a library to get
a volume by Arnold Bennett it makes no difference to the
individual whether the library is classified or not if he cannot
go to the shelves and pick out the book for himself.
Likewise, if he wants Young’s Astronomy he will probably
get the book more quickly if he asks the attendant to get
it than if he tries to get it himself, supposing he does have
access to the shelves. But the time when the reader gets
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
the most help from the classification is when he wants to
examine a number of books on astronomy and can go to the
shelves and find the books on that subject all in one place.
Then he can easily find what different writers have to say
about the habitability of Mars or he can find what book
appeals to him as being the most interesting and can borrow
it for home use. Any investigator finds access to the
shelves of a well classified library an immense help.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>An Aid to the Librarian.</b>—Another person who is greatly
benefited by classification is the librarian, and it is just as
important that he be helped as that the reader be helped.
He is, however, helped in a different way. He knows what
the system of classification in use in the library is and with
the outlines of this scheme in mind he goes through the
library and finds out where it is strong and where it is weak
and can plan future purchases accordingly. If, for example,
he finds on the shelves little of value on photography he
will make a note of it and buy more books on that subject
when funds are available. If he finds that there is an undue
supply of travel on hand, he will note that also and buy
fewer books in that class in the future. Without the help
of classification the librarian would overlook many such
irregularities. In an unclassified library they would be
discovered only through a long and tedious investigation.
His only recourse would be the catalog and that is not so
well adapted to answer such questions.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Basis of Classification.</b>—The next question is, what shall
be the basis of classification. It is obvious that this basis
should be sought in the character of the books themselves
and should be applied with constant reference to the reader
and his needs. In regard to the first point, character of
the books, we know that books have been written on all
kinds of subjects,—religion, law, history, medicine, etc.
and that those subjects form the only rational basis for
classification. A classification based on these distinctions
is the only one that helps the reader. If a man comes to
the library to investigate a particular point in medicine,
it is clear that it will help him if he finds all the medical
books together rather than all the books grouped according
to their date of purchase by the library.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Present Tendency.</b>—Many schemes have been devised
for the classification of books, some very simple, others
extremely elaborate. The present tendency is to adopt
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
the more elaborate classification. Formerly most libraries
were not classified at all, but the books were arranged in the
order in which they were received, the only grouping of the
books being in such cases one based on size,—folios in one
place, quartos in another, in order to save shelf room.
Assuming that the books in the library were numbered
according to the date of their accession from one up to, say,
twenty thousand, it is clear that the reader could find a
book by a particular writer quickly enough by looking
up its number in the catalog, but if he had wished to consult
thirty books on one subject, it would be a very tedious
operation and most readers would not take the time for it.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Simple forms of Classification.</b>—The most common plan
in English libraries is a modification of this scheme. The
books are divided into about ten classes and the books
in each class are arranged in the order in which they are
received. The classes are distinguished by capital letters.
An example said to be very common in England, is as follows.</p>

<p class='c010' >As an illustration of the way a book is marked in this
scheme, B 2574 might be Green’s “History of the English
people.” This book is marked B. because it is a history.
It is marked 2574 because there were already 2573 books
in this class at the time this book was added. This mark,
B 2574, is a very simple one and to that extent satisfactory.
The scheme is a great advance over the preceding one,
because it brings the books of a kind together. Since there
are ten classes in this scheme, it is evident that if a reader
wishes to see all the books on one subject he will have to
examine only one-tenth of the library instead of the whole
of it, but even this is not felt to be minute enough. If the
library contains 200,000 volumes one class would contain,
on the average, 20,000 volumes, which is altogether too great
a collection to search through. If Green’s “History of
the English people” were marked B 2574, the next book
might be Robinson’s “History of Peru,” marked B 2575,
which is of course a very different subject. The case is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
still worse in class E, which includes fine arts, useful arts
and all the sciences, so that a book on chemistry might
stand between a book on medicine and one on Raphael.
This would not satisfy the reading public of to-day,—nor
the modern librarian. The classes F, fiction, and J, juvenile,
are not so bad; there is not so great a difference between the
books in these classes. They are used more by people seeking
recreation, rather than by those looking for definite
titles. Jacob Abbott wrote some two hundred juvenile
books and many of these might be scattered among the
large class J. In class F, fiction, the English, French, and
German authors would all be thrown together. This
would be a disadvantage for any one desiring to read along
a particular line.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Open vs. Close Classification.</b>—The question of open vs.
close classification is an important one. By open classification
we mean one without minute subdivisions. An illustration
of open classification is the scheme of ten classes
described above. As an extreme case of open classification
mention may be made of the theological library in
which only two classes were used, the one class containing
the books that were sound in their theology, the other the
books that were unsound.</p>

<p class='c010' >At the present time the tendency is towards close classification.
It is a necessity in large libraries and an advantage
in small ones. In this country the two great authorities
on classification are Charles A. Cutter and Melvil Dewey.
Both have devised and published schemes of classification
which are generally recognized as having many excellent
features. In both schemes the classification admits of
very minute subdivisions. Dewey says that if the library
has only one book on a certain minute subject, that book
ought to be put in its own special class. It does not matter
if there is no other book in the class. No one can fully
understand what is meant by close classification until he
has had considerable experience in classifying books. You
can pick up the printed scheme of classification and run
your eye over the numbers, but you will get comparatively
little from them until you try to apply them.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Minute Bibliographical Classification.</b>—The following is
a very important distinction in regard to close classification
which should be carefully noted. It is one thing to classify
books, but it is quite a different thing to classify articles
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
in magazines for the bibliography of a subject. Magazine
articles may be classified far more minutely than books
can be. Take, for example, the Bibliographia Geologica,
in which references are made to articles in geological
magazines and publications of geological societies. Here
the articles are classified according to Dewey. Dewey’s
class 551 means physical geology. In this bibliography
there is a particular article marked 551.795,513,111,044.
That is to say the general subject of physical geology is
subdivided in one-trillionth parts and this article is assigned
to one of those parts. If one should apply for a library
position and be told that he should have to classify the
books as closely as this, he would probably never get the
position. If he were given this article to classify, he would
just as likely as not put it ten billion points out of the way.
As a matter of fact, this bibliography is compiled by a
number of experts in geology. There are similar bibliographies
of botany, zoology and other natural sciences,
all minutely classified and all compiled by experts.</p>

<p class='c010' >The reason that books cannot be as closely classified as
magazine articles is that they generally deal with broader
topics. In the average library it does not pay to classify
books more minutely than is warranted by the general
run of books in the class in which these books are to be
assigned. In this regard, a distinction must be made between
libraries. The Library of Congress has devised a classification
of its own which is very minute, and a number
of classifiers are employed to look after the different fields
in which they are more or less expert. In this way, classification
can be carried to the extreme limit of closeness.
Nothing keeps one more modest than classifying, for one
is continually brought face to face with things that one
does not know, and so many things of which one knows
so little.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>The Dewey Decimal Classification.</b> The decimal classification
is used in this country and in Europe. It is suitable
for both large and small collections of books and for
indexing. In many schemes of classification letters are
used to denote the classes, in others a combination of letters
and figures. Dewey uses only figures.</p>

<p class='c010' >Dewey developed his system in 1873 and published it
in 1876. Numbers of three figures were used to denote
the classes. Since then it has been found desirable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
subdivide much more minutely and this has been done with increasing
minuteness in the seven editions that have followed
the one of 1876. A general outline of Dewey is here given.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010' >These sections are still further subdivided until the
requisite degree of minuteness is reached. The system has
various mnemonic features which are helpful. Every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
figure has a meaning. An alphabetical list of all these
meanings is appended to the classification. Thus after
the word Hydraulics is 532, showing where to look in the
classification for this subject. All books on hydraulics
receive the number 532 and are together on the shelves.
This fact illustrates one great advantage of the Dewey
system, that as the library grows the new books can be
placed with the corresponding old ones without re-marking
the old ones, while in the fixed location system the books
are marked to certain localities, and when moved by reason
of growth of the library have to be re-marked. This re-marking
includes not only the books but also the cards
referring to the books. The re-marking is very costly and
very unsatisfactory. In Dewey’s system the books in any
one class are arranged according to some method. In most
classes an alphabetical arrangement by the names of the
authors is simplest and best. In scientific classes some librarians
prefer the chronological arrangement. In any case it
should be clear and simple.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Relative Location.</b>—“With a movable location all new
books fall at once into their proper places like the cards
which are added to a card catalog, and the new-comers
push the other books along on the shelf, just as new cards
push the others along in the drawer. The consequence
is that a book which is here to-day may be on the next
shelf in a month or in the next alcove in a year; and the
local memory, which is a great help in finding books quickly
is disturbed. The only remedy that I can see for this is
to substitute a subject memory for a local memory, to get
a habit of thinking of a book as belonging to a certain class
instead of as on a certain shelf (a much more rational memory,
by the way), and then to make it very easy to find the
classes. This last is not hard to accomplish. A class
memory can be cultivated and may be assisted by local
memory which will find books by their position relative
to other books, instead of by their position relative to
alcoves and shelves, or doors and windows.”—C. A. Cutter.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br /><b>CATALOGING.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' ><b>Definition.</b>—The catalog is a directory of the library. A library
without a catalog is described by Thomas Carlyle as
“a Polyphemus without any eye in its head, and you must
front the difficulties, whatever they may be, of making
proper catalogs.” A good catalog must be an accurate
and easily used index of the resources of the library, answering
the questions of the readers in the simplest and most
direct way possible. Such questions fall into the following
groups:</p>

<p class='c014' >1. Has the library a certain book by a certain author?</p>

<p class='c014' >2. What books by a certain author has the library?</p>

<p class='c014' >3. Has the library a book with a certain title, the author’s
name being unknown?</p>

<p class='c014' >4. What has the library on a given subject?</p>

<p class='c014' >5. What volumes of a certain series are in the library?</p>

<p class='c014' >6. Where on the shelves of the library is a certain book
to be found, if it is not in use by a reader?</p>

<p class='c010' >To answer these questions certain “entries”, or records,
are made in the catalog, called the author, title, subject
and series entries. Question 6, which is asked in connection
with all the other questions, is answered by the call
number, which appears on every entry.</p>

<p class='c010' >The most general book of reference is the dictionary.
Every one is more or less familiar with its arrangement.
This fact is the chief argument for a dictionary arrangement
in a card catalog where authors, subjects, titles and cross
references are arranged in one alphabet, as in a dictionary.
Each “entry,” or record, is made on a card having on its
first line the word, or words, under which the entry is made.
This card is placed in its alphabetical place in the catalog
tray.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Author Entry.</b>—Every book must have an author entry to
answer questions 1 and 2. By author we mean the person,
body, government, society or institution responsible for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
work. The entry is usually made under the author’s surname,
followed by his forenames.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Catalog Rules.</b>—Every good code of cataloging rules gives
detailed directions for the author entry, telling how to decide
who is the author and what form of his name to use. In
order to gain the uniformity necessary for the easy consultation
of the catalog, the cataloger must decide upon her
rules and then follow them carefully. If this is done, the
author card will ordinarily present few difficulties. The
American Library Association rules (1908) are very full
and offer the advantage of general conformity to the
Library of Congress entries. The question as to fullness
of author’s name may well be left to the individual library.
The small library will need to use the author’s dates only to
distinguish different authors of the same name. Many
descriptive phrases may also be omitted, e. g. “pres. of the
U. S.” in the heading, “Washington, George, pres. of the
U. S.” and similar headings. This will in no way interfere
with the use of the Library of Congress cards, in spite of
their fuller entries, as the full and less full may easily be
placed in one alphabet.</p>

<p class='c010' >All works of fiction, dramas and poems, and works of
non-fiction having striking titles must have an additional
record, or “added entry”, under the title, in order that
the catalog may answer question 3. For this entry, the
title is written at the top of the card. The average reader
more frequently remembers the titles of books than the
names of their authors. Consequently the cataloger must
not be too sparing in making title entries.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Subject Entries.</b>—Non-fiction must also have added entry
under the subject or subjects of the book. It is here that
the cataloger finds scope for all her knowledge, judgment
and common sense. Above all, let it not be said of her that she</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Affects all books of past and present ages,</div>
      <div class='line'>But reads no further than their title-pages.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >She must examine the books carefully, studying the table
of contents, preface, analyses of chapters when given,
marginal notes, and the chapters themselves when necessary.
No entry is to be made under any subject unless the cataloger
is sure that the book contains material helpful to one looking
up that subject. She must always try to put herself
in the reader’s place, and get his point of view.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
The cataloger is extremely liable to worship rules and
to forget the limitations of the average reader. There
is danger of taking too much for granted. In this respect
the cataloger is like a certain professor who was given to
quoting Arabic in his popular lectures. When some one,
remonstrated, he said, “Oh, everybody knows a little Arabic.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The cataloger must bear in mind the fact that many users
of the library do not know how to look up book titles.
President Eliot once confessed to a body of librarians that
although he might claim to be as intelligent as the ordinary
frequenter of a library, he did not know enough to use a card
catalog.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Cutter’s Rules.</b>—Having decided what the subject or
subjects of the book may be, for it may have one or
many, the question arises as to the form of the subject
headings to be used. C. A. Cutter, in his “Rules for
a dictionary catalog” (4th edition, <b>1904</b>) has laid down
the principles of the choice of subject headings. One of
the most useful tools of the cataloger is the American Library
Association “List of subject headings” (3d edition,
1911), the result of widespread consultation and discussion
on principles and practice. Here is gathered the experience
of many libraries, of all types, and the cataloger would do
well to follow this list unless experience has shown her that
in some cases her special library requires a variation. The
suggested cross references are a great help, but must be used
with care and judgment. The cross references are the
sign posts in the wilderness of the catalog, and they must
point the way clearly and with truth. The cataloger never
knows at just what point the reader will strike the catalog,
but if the subject headings and cross references have been
judiciously chosen he is pretty sure to reach the desired
goal.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Analyticals.</b>—In a small library it is most essential to
show not only what books the library has on a given subject,
but also what chapters or essays may be hidden in
unsuspected volumes. Entries for such parts of books
are called analytical entries. The subject heading is chosen
in the same manner as for an entire work on the subject,
the author, title, date, call number and paging of the volume
containing the chapter being given below the subject heading.
In similar manner author and title analytical entries
may be made for short stories which appear in collections.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
Author analytical entries are frequently needed for collections
of essays, etc.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Form of Card.</b>—The form of the card is of minor importance,
provided it is clear and gives all of the important
information. It is well to make prominent the author’s
name by indention. The title must omit nothing which
will aid the reader in his choice of a book. The name or
number of edition and the name of the editor or translator
should be included. Names of illustrators may be omitted
unless they are of sufficient importance to require an added
entry card. In a public library added entries under the
names of popular illustrators like C. D. Gibson, Joseph
Pennell or Walter Crane, will often prove helpful.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Imprint and Collation.</b>—Fullness of imprint and collation
varies in different libraries. The cataloger should not count
on the library always remaining very small, but should include
enough details of imprint and collation to assure
her that the cards will be useful when the library has grown.
The A. L. A. rules give detailed instruction for imprint
and collation, while any of the papers written on cataloging
for the small library will point out the possibilities of simplification.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Contents Notes.</b>—The contents of the book should be
given whenever it will add important items to the reader’s
knowledge of the book. Descriptive and critical notes will
often tell a reader positively whether or not he wishes the
book, when the title alone could not do this.</p>

<p class='c010' >Subject headings for historical fiction—and also for
poetry and drama—will be found most helpful. Thus
Winston Churchill’s “Crisis” can well have an entry
under U. S. History—Civil War—Fiction, and Dumas’
The Whites and the Blues, an entry under Napoleon I—Fiction.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Printed Cards.</b>—The use of the Library of Congress
cards will be found a great labor saver. If, at the time
of ordering the cards, a temporary slip bearing call number,
author, title, place and date of publication, accession number
and suggested subjects and analyticals be written, a
second examination of the book on the receipt of the cards
will be unnecessary, unless the cards disagree with the book
in some of the data noted. The Library of Congress, on
application, will send instructions for the ordering of
cards. Although it is cheaper to order cards by serial
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
numbers, it will not pay the cataloger to spend much time
searching for this number as for 1/2c per title the Library
of Congress will do this work. The use of the printed
cards, though it will destroy the uniformity of appearance
of the catalog, will in no way detract from its usefulness
or usableness.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Essentials.</b>—The cataloger must constantly bear in mind
that the catalog is a machine for the use of the public.
Any time spent in making it serve the readers more easily
and quickly is time well spent. Any time spent in beautifying
it simply for the glorification of the cataloger is time
wasted. Rules,—careful, detailed rules,—are needed so
that the machine may do its work without friction and that
every part may fit into its proper place, but any rules that
hamper the user of the machine, should be promptly struck
from the code. The cataloger is paid to make a time-saving
machine, and this is her duty,—to make a machine
that will bring together the book and the man who wants
it with the least expenditure of effort on the part of the
latter.</p>

<p class='c010' >“If the trustees can afford it,” very rightly says Miss
Esther Crawford, “there is one substitute for a catalog,
viz., a librarian who knows intimately every book in the
library; who has the memory for each book and that fine,
discriminating knowledge of the reader’s tastes and abilities
which will enable her always to fit the right book to the
right person; who will never be absent from the library
during the ten hours in which it is kept open every day in
the year; who will never die nor take a vacation,—marriage
is out of the question.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010' ><b>The Cataloger’s Training.</b>—“The modern library movement
is young, and it is therefore not surprising that the
subject of library work in general and of cataloging in
particular is not fully understood,” writes Miss Theresa
Hitchler in the eighth annual report of the Brooklyn Public
Library. “The average man does not know and cannot
realize the demands of the work, and has no idea, seemingly,
that any training or special aptitude is necessary.
By way of contrast to this average man’s view might be
recorded the plaint of a prominent librarian at a recent
library club meeting that so great a per cent of the talent
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
of the library profession had to be diverted to the cataloging
department, to the detriment of the circulating desk.
The moral to be pointed out is that the catalog must
be good as a first requisite to a library. In the words of
the old comparison, the catalog is the key to the otherwise
hidden material buried in books. In a library of any size, the
best desk attendant in the world is almost helpless, or at
best constantly handicapped, without a convenient and rational
classification of the volumes of the collection and the
bibliographical aid of a catalogue. The born bibliographer is
as rare as the born teacher or poet. The cataloging expert
must have the quick mind, sound common sense, broad
view and good judgment of the book-reviewer joined with
the slow and solid qualities of the bibliographer. The
former qualities are needed for rapid classification of books
in all the various fields of human knowledge, from abstruse
to practical, from grave to gay, and for placing them under
subject headings in the catalog useful and specific, to
student, scholar and every day reader alike, and are by
far the more important and indispensable. The latter
qualities are needed for recording accurately the data of
the books so classed, in a bibliographical catalog of a form
useful to people of all grades of intelligence. It stands to
reason that to cope with these requirements, a solid educational
training that gives an intelligent outlook on the
various fields of knowledge must be joined to a natural
aptitude for bibliographical detail, and added to these a
technical training in such work. The head of such a department
must possess these requirements in an ever greater
degree, with an executive ability and knowledge of human
nature above the ordinary, since the results, good or bad,
depend directly on her ability and on her management,
successful or unsuccessful, of the varied material entrusted
to her guidance.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br /><b>REFERENCE WORK AND CIRCULATION.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' ><b>Reference Work.</b>—By “reference work” is meant work
done in assisting the public to use the resources of the
library. Dewey defines it as “systematic aid to readers.”
A reference book according to Dr. E. C. Richardson “is
a book which is to be consulted for definite points of information,
rather than read through, and is arranged with
explicit reference to ease in finding specific facts.” In
this class fall dictionaries, encyclopaedias and hand-books
of all kinds. The same answer to almost any question
may be found in a number of books in the library by taking
the time to examine them carefully, but the object of the
reference department is to serve the public as expeditiously
and satisfactorily as possible and reference books are the
means to that end. Any book referred to becomes for
the time being a reference book; but the term “reference
book” as used in a library refers to the “ready reference
book,” i. e. the books that were specifically written for
reference use and to which the definition given above refers.</p>

<p class='c010' >The reference collection is usually a small but exceedingly
valuable portion of the library and the reference work does
not confine itself to the use of the reference books, but to
any book in the library which may contain something
which will help towards the desired answer. The reference
collection is generally placed in the reading room of the
library and in that part of the room most convenient to
the public and to the librarian.</p>

<p class='c010' >The reference department is the heart of the library, and
the more alive and efficient the members of the department
are, the stronger is the beat of its pulse and the more far
reaching the results of its work. All other departments
exist to make more efficient the work of the reference department.
The accessions department purchases books
that there may be live material to work with in the reference
department. The classifier groups the books so that all
the material on the various subjects in the library is placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
most conveniently on the shelves. The cataloging department
catalogs the books so that the reference department
may by the simplest means find what is contained
in the library. Without the work of the other departments
the reference department would be tied hand and foot and
might as well not exist. With their cooperation it becomes
the very life of the library, reaching out in various ways into
the community to make the influence of the library more
strongly felt.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Importance of Reference Work.</b>—The average reader is
uninformed as to the use and helpfulness of any but the
commonest reference books. The duty of instructing the
readers in the use of the ordinary library tools devolves
upon the assistants at the reference desk. They must
interpret the catalog to the public and incite in the readers
a desire to help themselves after they have been initiated
into the use of a dictionary card catalog and have had the
use of some of the more important reference books explained
to them. If an education consists not so much in getting
knowledge as in knowing how and where to get it when
the need arises, then it is clear that the assistants at the
reference desk fill an important place in the library staff.
They have a great opportunity for helpfulness. Other
divisions of the library may labor successfully to build
up the collections, and have them properly classified and
cataloged, but if the service at the reference desk is inefficient
the usefulness of the library is sadly impaired. The
reference assistants can make or mar the library’s reputation
for service.</p>

<p class='c010' >Of course there is such a thing as doing too much for the
patrons of a library, thereby preventing their learning how
to help themselves. Let the readers understand that it is
necessary to dig into the contents of the books and discover
things that the bibliographies and card catalogs cannot
point out.</p>

<p class='c010' >Don’t say off hand, “I don’t know that we have anything
on the subject,” for fear that before long you will be saying
categorically that “The library has nothing on the subject.”
You should aid the inquirer by beginning the search. Say
rather, “Let us see what the library has on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c010' >When the books are purchased and on the shelves, and
the catalog is in perfect shape for use, the library is still a
riddle to the public. There must be one or more capable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
persons to meet the public and put the contents of the
library at its disposal. “Knowledge is of two kinds,”
said Dr. Johnson. “We know our subject and we know where
we can find information upon it.” The latter is the knowledge
necessary to the reference librarian. Her knowledge
of her library must be such that she can find something
about any question asked, if there is material on the subject
in the library. What great novel is there on the period of
the Norman conquest? Where can I find a map of the
city of Seattle? Who was the last man elected to the
French Academy? What is the point of resemblance
between Maeterlinck’s writings and Coleridge’s Ancient
Mariner? Was Rabbi Ben Ezra a mathematician? Such
are the questions for which she must be ready, from morning
till night, to help find the answers.</p>

<p class='c010' >The efficiency of the department is many times increased
if it can have on its staff those who in addition to their
knowledge of the library have had a broad education.
The broader the better for there is no subject on which she
may not at some time be asked to find material. The more
versatile the members of the department are the greater is
its efficiency.</p>

<p class='c010' >In no department of the library does personality count
for as much as in the reference department. The reference
librarian may be a brilliant student and have a thorough
grasp of the various fields of knowledge, but of what use will
it be to her if she has not the ability to meet people and
to sink her own personality to a large extent? There is
no profession which throws one into the society of more
varied types than that of librarianship. The high and the
low, the rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant,
the cultured and unrefined all come to the library for aid.
The reference librarian must “be all things to all people.”
She must meet her public in such a way that if they come
once they will come again, feeling themselves cordially
welcome. She must have all the qualities which will make
the library a place to which the public will want to come,
and herself the person they will seek for assistance.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>How to Meet the Public.</b>—“The whole library should be
permeated with a cheerful and accommodating atmosphere.
Treat boy and girl, man and woman, ignorant and learned,
gracious and rude, with uniform good temper, without
condescension, never pertly. Anticipate all inquiries when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
possible, and especially put the shrinking and embarrassed
visitor at once at ease.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Reference work in libraries large and small has for its
first rule: Meet the inquirer more than half way. To the
stranger a library is often an oppressive place, an awesome
place—in his imagination. He comes in shyly; everyone
appears busy, his question suddenly seems to him trivial;
he won’t trouble these wise and busy people with it—and
goes out.</p>

<p class='c010' >“A good second rule is: Learn at once just exactly what
the inquirer wishes to know. This is not always easy.
Tact and a little patience will generally effect it.</p>

<p class='c010' >“A third good rule is: Whenever possible show the inquirer
how the answer is found, so that he may next time
in some measure help himself. It is surprising how many,
especially of the younger people in a community, can be
taught within one year, on their occasional visits, to make
the proper use of at least a few reference books.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Another rule of very good application is: Go first to a
dictionary. In many cases a question answers itself, or
betrays where its answer may best be found, if it is once
plainly stated. And nothing is better than reference to
a few words in a dictionary for the clear statement of a
question. The larger dictionaries, and notably the Century,
will answer many more inquiries than even great readers
often suppose.”—John Cotton Dana, in his “Library primer”
and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Reference Books.</b>—In helping to answer an inquiry or
to find material on a subject, the first question in the mind
of the reference assistant should be, not where, or in what
particular book, shall I find the information, but rather:
In what kind of a book, or in what class of books? While
it is necessary that the assistant should early become acquainted
with the most important or most convenient works
of reference on the various subjects of general interest it
is especially desirable to know the point of view of the
inquirer, and what sort of books, whether reference or
research, will be needed.</p>

<p class='c010' >Reference books—meaning ready reference books—may
be generally divided into two great classes: Dictionaries
and Encyclopedias. The first includes those works which
treat of words used as language; their meaning, history,
pronunciation and use. The second class treats of subjects,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
such as countries, men, animals, sciences, arts, trades and substances;
their character, history, distribution, etc. In both of
these classes the arrangement of the matter is generally alphabetical.
The term “dictionary” is frequently used for a
cyclopedia of a special subject, as in the case of dictionaries
of biography, antiquities and architecture. Books of facts,
almanacs, yearbooks and census returns, belong to this
class.</p>

<p class='c010' >Of the general, or universal encyclopedias, devoted to
all classes of subjects without regard to country, age, or
character, every public or school library, no matter how
small, should have at least one, and the larger libraries
should possess several, as they differ considerably in their
treatment of the subjects. Encyclopedias published in
the United States, England, France and Germany, while
treating of matters of interest in all these countries, would
naturally favor their own nationality and include subjects
in which their immediate readers would be most interested.</p>

<p class='c010' >A third class, to which the general name of bibliography
is usually given, includes not only the indexes to the literature
of a subject but catalogs of libraries, special collections,
selected lists, etc. Frequently these are the books to be
consulted first, as they direct the searcher to works and
articles of far more importance than any of the general
ready reference books.</p>

<p class='c010' >One of the most important and useful books with which
the reference assistant should become acquainted is Miss
Kroeger’s “Guide to the study and use of reference books,”
(A. L. A. Publishing board, 1908; Supplement, by Isadore
G. Mudge, 1910). It is divided into classes by formal
subjects, but the annotations to the titles included are generally
sufficient to show the character of the works, and
to what kind of needs they would be best adapted. The
Michigan State board of Library Commissioners has published
a handy “Annotated list of reference books for school
and public libraries,” 1910, which will be found useful by
those in charge of smaller libraries.</p>

<p class='c010' >There are certain ready reference books which should
be within reach of every reading room assistant and with
which all should be familiar. Among these the following
may be mentioned:</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Poole’s Index and the Reader’s Guide.</b>—In 1848 William
F. Poole, at that time a junior at Yale, and librarian of one
of the undergraduate literary societies, began indexing by
topics such magazines as were available “for the purpose
of helping students in the preparation of their written
exercises and society discussions.” Mr. Poole had noticed
that the sets of standard periodicals with which the library
was well supplied were not used, although they were replete
with information on subjects about which inquiries were
made in vain every day. Mr. Poole’s manuscript index
soon showed serious signs of wear and in order to preserve
it recourse was had to printing. An edition of 500 copies,
printed in 1848 was soon exhausted, and in 1853 an edition
of 1000 of a much enlarged index was published. Mr.
Poole’s increasing duties as librarian of the Boston Athenaeum,
and later of the public libraries of Cincinnati and
Chicago, left him no leisure for carrying on the index, and
so at the first meeting of the American Library Association
in 1876 he proposed that the work be carried on by co-operation.
This plan was adopted and with Mr. Poole
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
as editor-in-chief and Mr. W. I. Fletcher as assistant and
with the cooperation of some fifty libraries the work was
carried on until Mr. Poole’s death in 1894. The first
volume of this cooperative venture appeared in 1882, with
supplements in 1888, 1893, 1897, 1903, and 1908, after
which the publication was suspended.</p>

<p class='c010' >In 1901 the H. W. Wilson Company of Minneapolis
began the publication of a monthly “Readers’ guide to
Periodical literature,” with the view to supplying the needs
of the very small libraries. It was to be cumulated quarterly
and it increased rapidly in scope. In 1903 there was incorporated
with it the “Cumulative index to periodicals”
which had been published in Cleveland for several years.
Two five-year cumulations covering 1900-04 and 1905-09
have been published and have grown rapidly in favor.
This publication will henceforward continue the work of
the Poole Index.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Public Documents.</b>—Among the sources of reliable information
most prized by the properly trained desk attendant
must be reckoned the various series of documents published
by the United States Government. While hitherto
many depository libraries have been swamped with the
output of the Government Printing Office for which the
libraries could not provide proper shelf-room, the libraries
are now, by a process of selection and elimination, coming
to learn what volumes are of most use to their particular
clientele. It is better for a small library to buy these from
the Government Printing Office than to have a whole lot
of documents for which they have no call dumped down
on them. Among the United States documents the following
will be found the most useful for the average public
library:</p>

<p class='c014' >Congressional record.</p>

<p class='c016' >Bound volumes; contain daily proceedings of Congress.
If the daily edition is procurable it ought to be filed
with the daily newspapers. An index is issued every two
weeks, and, with the bound volume, one for the entire
session. Obtainable through the local Congressman.</p>

<p class='c014' >Census Bureau. Reports and bulletins.</p>

<p class='c016' >Cotton ginning reports. Contain comparative tables
of the amount of cotton ginned from the crops grown.</p>

<p class='c016' >

lumber and timber products.</p>

<p class='c016' >Tobacco reports.</p>

<p class='c016' >Special reports. Complete statistical reports on subjects
of great importance. The abstract of the
census is an exceedingly useful reference manual
supplementing the annual statistical abstract.</p>

<p class='c014' >Statistical abstract of the United States.</p>
<p class='c016' >A comprehensive manual of general information issued
annually. Advance edition in paper binding available
through Congressman.</p>

<p class='c016' >Embody the results of the Commissioner’s investigations
and labors, with statistics and special articles,
and recommendations which will promote the purpose
for which the office was established. While chiefly
devoted to the educational system of the United
States, there are papers on important educational
movements in other countries. The bulletins include
the annual bibliography of Education.</p>

<p class='c014' >Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p class='c016' >Yearbook. A most interesting and valuable compend
of scientific knowledge, practically applied to agricultural
life. It contains also much statistical information
of use to farmers and others. It has been
issued annually, beginning with 1894, and has become
very widely known.</p>

<p class='c016' >Farmers’ bulletins and bulletins of the Weather Bureau,
Forestry, Plant Industry, Chemistry, Entomology,

Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p class='c016' >National Museum. Reports. Annual. Administrative
report on the progress and condition of the Museum.
The Congressional edition bears the same document
number as the Smithsonian report, though the law
calls for separate publication. The earlier volumes
contained a number of articles on American archaeology,
but the general appendix of scientific papers
has not been printed since 1904.</p>

<p class='c016' >Bureau of Ethnology. Reports and bulletins. Reports.
Annual. Contain collections of illustrated
papers, relating to the habits, customs, languages,
folk-lore, religious ceremonials, etc., of the North

the North American Indians. Similar to the annual
reports in character and contents.</p>

<p class='c014' >Geological Survey.</p>
<p class='c016' >Maps. Geologic atlas of United States. Issued in
parts or folios as surveys are completed for various
areas. Each folio comprises topographic, geologic,

<p class='c010' ><b>State Documents.</b>—In addition to the United States
Documents referred to above there are a number of State
Documents which will prove especially helpful as reference
sources in a public library. They are generally to be
secured through the Secretary of State, and for Michigan
the following might be specified:</p>

<p class='c014' >Constitutional Convention, 1907-8, Journal and Debates
(4 vols). The Journal contains comparative text of
the Constitutions of 1908 and 1850.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Loan Systems.</b>—The function of the loan department has
been thus defined: “To give to the reader the books he
wants to take home and to make sure that he will return
them promptly for the sake of other readers.” To this
end a systematic record of books loaned is kept.</p>

<p class='c010' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
This record may be made to answer certain questions
which arise in different kinds of libraries. (1) What books
are due on a certain day? This is the “time record.” It
is the record usually kept and is necessary to insure the
library against loss and to safeguard the interests of the
community. (2) What books are out, or, is a certain book
out? Who has it and when is it due? It is the “book
record” and this kind of a record is kept in most college
libraries. (3) What books does a certain person have out?
This is called the “readers or borrowers record.” Although
some libraries keep all three of these records, many keep
only two and the majority only one.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is not possible to say that there is one best charging
system although some form of the Newark or the Brown
system is commonly used. All systems require a register of
the “borrowers,” kept either numerically in a book or
alphabetically on cards or both. Some libraries require
a sponsor or guarantor for each one drawing books, but
this is going out of favor and only an identification is demanded.
When the library is small or the patronage is
large it is customary to limit the number of volumes a
person can have out at one time to two, one volume of
fiction and one non-fiction. These volumes can be kept
from seven to fourteen days with the privilege of renewing
them for an equal length of time. Other libraries give much
more freedom in the number of books one person may draw
and in the length of time they may be retained.</p>

<p class='c010' >Most charging systems require that each book in the
library be fitted with a pocket into which is slipped a “book
card” on which may appear the author and title of the
book, the class and book numbers and the accession number.
When the book is drawn out this card is removed from the
book and is kept in the library. On it may be entered the
borrower’s name or number and the date the book is drawn
or to be returned. A card may also be issued to each reader
for purposes of identification or to aid in charging the book.
Such a card is a “reader’s card” or “borrower’s card.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><b>THE BINDING AND CARE OF LIBRARY BOOKS.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' ><b>Library Binding.</b>—The average library is spending about
six percent of its total income on binding. The newer
and smaller libraries spend less because their books have
not yet come to need the binder’s attention. The older
and larger libraries spend more because of the large number
of books needing to be rebound and the numerous periodicals
taken.</p>

<p class='c010' >The essentials of good library binding are durability,
flexibility, neatness, high grade of materials and suitability
of style. Library bookbinding is distinct from the ordinary
machine made “case” or publisher’s cloth binding and the
decorative binding favored by bibliophiles and amateurs.
The weak points in modern book making are poor paper,
imperfect sewing, poor attachment of the book to the cover,
lack of flexibility in the back and joint, perishable leather
and cloth used in the binding. The results are that leaves
become loosened, the joints broken and the linings of the
hollow backs come off and the boards separate. The
present tendency is to strengthen weak joints by using
double boards, inserting between them the linings and tapes
on which the book is sewn.</p>

<p class='c010' >Much of the durability of a binding depends upon the
quality of glue used. The cost of glue used on a book
cannot always be determined by the price paid per pound,
since the cheaper glue will not cover as much surface as
the higher grade glue which absorbs more water. The
cheap article is a great detriment to the life of the paper,
the free opening of the book and the flexibility of the back.
“Flexible glue” as made in this country is a misnomer.
To say the least it is not all that the manufacturers claim
for it.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Leather.</b>—The old saying that there is nothing like
leather for wear no longer holds true. Modern leather
is much less durable than old leather. Modern leather
bindings decay mainly because of improper methods of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
tanning, the use of dried and cured skins of inferior quality;
the use of acids and other injurious agents in the bleaching
and dyeing processes, the removal of the natural oils and
the splitting and artificial graining of the skins. Red and
some shades of brown are the colors found to be most durable.
Many of the bright colored dyes seem to hasten
decay. Leathers that look alike may wear very differently.
Names applied to various grades mean less and less. The
experience of recent years with the leathers used in book
binding has led librarians to a wider use of book cloths of
various kinds.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Cloth.</b>—The cloths most in favor are (1) buckram, which
if made in the United States, is a strong cotton cloth, suitable
for books of average size subject to a fair amount of
wear. The “library buckram,” made by the Holliston
Mills, Norwood, Mass., and the “legal buckram,” made
by the Joseph Bancroft Sons Co., of Wilmington, Del.,
are made according to the specifications drawn up by the
Bureau of Standards for use on government documents.
(2) Duck, or canvas, is the heaviest cloth used in binding
and is especially advised for newspapers and heavy periodicals
which are seldom used. (3) Imperial morocco cloth
is frequently used on fiction and juveniles. It does not
take lettering as easily as the buckram. (4) Keratol is a
washable cloth which is used by some binders on the sides
of fiction and juveniles bound in half leather. It should
never be used for full binding.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Preservation.</b>—Bindings should not be exposed to the
direct rays of the sun and the temperature of the building
should not exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Good ventilation
is a great aid to book preservation. Dampness affects
injuriously both the binding and paper. If leather bound
books are handled much the oil from the hands keeps the
leather in fair condition. For leather books not often
consulted, the necessary oil should be supplied by application.
Vaseline has been used with success, but a more
generally satisfactory preservative is the following: Pure
castor-oil with one half of its weight of paraffin wax heated
in an earthen jar until the wax melts. Apply with a flannel
cloth, paying special attention to the backs and joints.
Use sparingly but rub thoroughly. Then wipe with a clean
flannel.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Care of Books.</b>—In order to insure the proper handling
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
of books by the public, the staff must set a good example
in this respect. Care should be used in opening a new
book so as to loosen but not break the joints of the binding.
Careless cutting of the leaves produces a ragged appearance
which is not conducive to increased respect for the volume,
after it gets out into circulation. Suitable paper cutters
with smooth dull edges should be provided and nothing else
used. Don’t trust the public to cut the leaves of new
books or magazines. Many reputable people are worse than
careless in this matter.</p>

<p class='c010' >Books should not be piled up very high, nor wedged
into overcrowded shelves. They must be kept dry. Dampness
is destructive to both paper and binding.</p>

<p class='c010' >Do not turn books face downwards when open, nor allow
others to do so without politely calling their attention
to this piece of thoughtlessness. Books should be used
for reading and for nothing else. Open them gently and
try not to let them fall. Do not try to carry too many at
one time.</p>

<p class='c010' >Cleanliness is a great help to book preservation. A habit
of constant watchfulness for books needing repairs should
be developed by every member of the staff. “A stitch
in time saves nine” in a library if anywhere.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><b>WORK WITH CHILDREN.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >The proper age for a child to become a patron of the
library is the age when he has the inclination to visit the
library, possibly with older brothers and sisters, to look
at picture books, hear stories told, and in case he is too
young to be responsible for a borrower’s card, occasionally
to induce the older brothers and sisters to take home a
book for his use. A child’s first reading is by means of
pictures and his first introduction to literature through
stories told or read aloud, and even as early as the picture
book period the library has the responsibility of supplying
the child’s need and desire for experience through books
and of developing his taste by putting before him the best.
The child who grows up with the library will be a more
intelligent and appreciative user of the adult department
than he would be had he grown up without the library.</p>

<p class='c010' >The children should have a place of their own where
they can find that which is for them, be somewhat out
of the way of adult patrons and feel a sense of ownership,
feel that some part of the library belongs to them.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the small library, if a separate children’s room is not
a possibility, let there be at least a corner fitted up as the
children’s domain. Let it be made attractive for them. If
possible, have the shelving lower than ordinary, or perhaps
the regulation height with the two upper shelves boarded
up and covered with cork carpet, making a frieze on which
can be posted temporary sets of pictures. A frieze space
can be utilized in a number of ways. By all means have
at least one low table with chairs to correspond; the ideal
way is to have two heights of tables,—about 23 and 27
inches with chairs 13 and 15 inches in height. Low racks
for picture books and the magazines for children are convenient
and attractive. A space for picture bulletins or
illustrated reading lists is useful as a means of attracting
attention to fresh interest in reading, to material on popular
subjects, or to neglected classes of books. If framed pictures
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
can be afforded, there are good prints, lithographs
and photographs which, if carefully chosen, can be both
decorative and educational from the standpoint of art,
as well as pleasing in themselves to the children. There
should be, if possible, at least one picture or reproduction
of sculpture representing a work of art of permanent value.</p>

<p class='c010' >The books for the youngest children represent a distinct
class of reading and should be separated from the others
in order that the little children need not search through
the whole collection to find their own. It is best to shelve
this collection near the picture books on the one hand and
the fairy tales on the other, thus allowing the children to
find the next step at hand.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Rules.</b>—It should be remembered that rules and discipline
are for the moral benefit of the children even more
than for the protection of the library and it is wise to make
rules only as they are found necessary, but once made,
let them be enforced. The key note of successful discipline
is sympathy with child nature. Through personal,
persistent work a desired atmosphere of order becomes
to a great extent established and obedience to unwritten
laws a habit, although each individual case requiring discipline
may require individual treatment, children being
individuals. Problems of racial temperament and social
education, depending on the classes of society with which
one is dealing, enter largely into all phases of library work.
One working with children has many opportunities to
become an influence for good in their lives by way of little
courtesies and obedience to laws of order and fairness,
which are taught as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='c010' >Rules governing fines for overdue and damaged books
must be decided according to the policy of individual libraries.
It is not good for children to feel that a fine can
be outlawed; better remit it for sufficient reasons or try
the plan of allowing them, in certain cases, to work out the
fine,—a plan which has been found satisfactory in some
libraries. A damaged book should never be passed without
notice.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Books for children.</b>—The great purpose of library work
with children is to attract the children to books: satisfying
individual needs and demands, and guiding their reading.
Hence, the two most important requisites for the children’s
librarian are a knowledge of children and of books, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
if there is but one thing she can do by way of preparation
for this work, let it be that of becoming acquainted with
a few children’s books representative of various types.
Nothing can take the place of first hand knowledge of the
books and of intelligence in placing the right book in the
hands of the right child at the right time.</p>

<p class='c010' >To be capable of guiding the reading of children it is
necessary for one, first, to have appreciation and discernment
in adult literature, second, to gain the child’s point
of view. The various printed book lists are helpful, but
the librarian should depend upon her own judgment as
final critic in the selection of books for her children’s collection.
She must realize the qualities essential to particular
classes of books, such as history, and biography, science,
travel, fiction, and the qualities which make them suitable
for children. In the matter of books of science, etc., it
is always best to obtain the judgment of some authority
in this line as to their accuracy. As to their suitability
for children in presentation,—simplicity of treatment and
interest of style,—the worker with children is still the best
judge. The story style of presenting science is, as a general
thing, of little use. Children can take their informative
reading in a straightforward way. Nothing is more disappointing
to them than to take a book for the sake of
the story and find that it is only information with a story
covering, or to search for some definite information and
be constantly hindered by the narrative.</p>

<p class='c010' >As to the real literature for children, or the story, perhaps
there is no surer way of gaining discrimination than by
reading some of the classics for children and some of the
standard fiction; e. g., a few of the old favorite folk tales,
myths, and such adaptations for children as Marvin’s
Adventures of Odysseus and French’s Heroes of Iceland;
books of fiction such as Pyle’s Men of Iron, Kipling’s Captains
Courageous, Spyri’s Heidi. The children’s collection
should be kept well rounded and should contain a fair proportion
of good poetry, chosen from various standpoints:
all that is childlike in subject and form, much that is beyond
the average child but appreciated by the unusual
one,—poetry chosen for beauty of sound or charm of movement.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Work with Schools.</b>—The library must keep pace with the
course of study in the schools and develop its school reference
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
work with teachers and pupils by proving its helpfulness.
The adult collection will always be found an important
help in reference work. The duplication of certain titles
to meet the school demand for supplementary reading
should be made only as far as is possible without injustice
to the children’s room collection as a whole.</p>

<p class='c010' >The lending of sets of books for class room libraries is
best begun with schools at a distance too great for the
children to walk to the library to get their books. These
collections are made up of about fifty books, not text books
nor required supplementary reading, but books following
the line of certain parts of the school work and books of
imaginative reading. A simple method is usually devised
for statistics of circulation, such as a large card for each
book on which is written the name of the child who is reading
the book.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Story Hours.</b>—The story hour is an ideal way of presenting
the classic literature. If there is plenty of time for story
hours and for proper preparation, a satisfactory division of
children and of literature is to invite the younger children to
hear the folk tales and other literature suited to their age, but
not to have an age limit excluding older children who would
enjoy coming and perhaps have never heard these stories;
the children of ten years and over being invited to hear
Greek and Norse myths and cycles, such as the sagas, the
mediaeval legends, ballads, stories from Homer, etc., and
miscellaneous stories suited to their age. The stories
which come to us from the folk literature and other classic
sources are to a great extent universal in interest and appeal
to all classes and nationalities of children.</p>

<p class='c010' >One story hour per week is often as much as the small library
has time for and no story hour at all is preferable to
the telling of stories poorly prepared, or told by one without
appreciation. Poetry hours and clubs for reading, debating,
travel study, etc., are important methods of interesting,
inspiring and guiding children. The love of poetry may
be kept alive by giving it orally and for pure joy in the
story hour, reading circles or occasional readings to small
groups.</p>

<p class='c010' >Visits to the homes of the children for one reason or
another, and visits to the school rooms to tell stories, to
remind the children of the library, or merely to show an
interest in the work of the different grades, will prove
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
fruitful in many ways. Short printed lists of books on
different subjects are useful in suggesting new lines of
reading to children.</p>

<p class='c010' >It is the privilege of the librarian to enrich the lives of her
youthful patrons. There are compensations for those in
charge of small libraries, where a trained children’s librarian
cannot be afforded, in opportunities for a greater share
in the joy of working with the receptive thought of the
child, while the work with parents and teachers as well
gives deeper insight into the sympathy for the needs of
the children.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><b>THE HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >“There is no problem relating to the equipment of the
high school which is more pressing than that of the library,”
said a recent editorial writer in the <b>School Review</b>. At
the annual meeting of the New York State Library Association,
in 1907, Dr. Downing, State Commissioner of
Education, suggested that some special study be given
to the question of high school libraries and a committee
was later appointed to make an investigation of library
conditions in high schools and report at the annual meeting
in September, 1909. A questionnaire was sent to some
eighty-three schools, but only a few of the replies contained
more than the briefest answers. Twenty-five out of the
fifty-two libraries heard from were in charge of librarians
who had some library experience or training. Most of
the librarians had been appointed to high school positions
since 1903. The first appointment of a high school librarian
in New York City was in 1900. The investigation
as a whole was unsatisfactory, inasmuch as the high schools
reporting were not representative of conditions throughout
the State, much less throughout the country generally,
and because the replies left much unsaid as to the actual
use of and interest in these libraries.</p>

<p class='c010' >In a discussion of “The difficulty of the high school
library,”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Mr. Edwin White Gaillard, supervisor of work
with schools, New York Public Library, claims that the
problem is largely one of money and deprecates the duplication
of work already being done by the public library.
This is no more of an argument against high school libraries
than are similar objections against departmental libraries
in a university. The high school library is for a special
kind of work—work that can best be done in the school
building, under the supervision and guidance of one
familiar with the special needs of the student. Mr. Gaillard
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
grants that much, of course, may be learned about libraries
and library methods in the high school library, but claims
that the library habit, the habit of going to the public
library for all sorts of information, of little or of great
interest, cannot be acquired from the high school library.
This is a point which cannot be conceded. University librarians
are familiar with a similar argument against technical
departmental libraries to the effect that they have a tendency
to make the technical student feel that there is no need of
his going to the University Library, that the departmental
library answers all his needs. Experience, however, proves
that to have these students use any library you must plant it
right in their midst. So with the high school students: give
them a good library in their own school building and then
see that they use it properly, for this is a part of modern
education.</p>

<p class='c010' >In these days when high schools are extending their work
in so many directions and when books must be provided
for supplementary work in English, in history, in the preparation
of debates, and in other subjects, a well-equipped
library is a necessity in the modern high school. A motley
array of old text-books, out-of-date encyclopædias and
miscellaneous volumes from the attics of well-meaning
friends of the institution will not make a good high school
library. Upon how many school libraries in this country
can former pupils look back as did Burne-Jones upon the
little school library at Birmingham, as “that blessed institution
where we spent many blissful hours.” The failure
of many school libraries is due to a lack of proper care and
fostering attention after they have been established. The
library is there out of deference to a growing public sentiment
in favor of such an annex, but the library is too frequently
left to run itself, or the responsibility for its care is given
to some teacher already overburdened with class-room
work. The responsibility ought never to be placed on the
teachers, or at least not on one who is doing full work as a
teacher. The average teacher, if given charge of a school
library, will confine her efforts to seeing that the rules
are obeyed, that books are brought in on time, and that
silence and order are preserved. She will not have time
or energy to devote to the building up of the library, to
instruct the pupils in its use, to look after reference work
with the students, nor to help the teachers in finding needed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
material. “Disabuse yourselves of the notion that it is
teachers’ work, and a way out of the difficulty will be found,”
says a recent writer in the Library Journal.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010' >The school library differs from the average public library
in that it is usually a reference library first and a lending
library only so far as the use of its books outside the building
does not conflict with the usefulness of its service to the
teachers and pupils in the school building.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Duties of the Librarian.</b>—The first duty of the librarian
is to make the books, photographs, and other possessions
of the library available by a simple and acceptable system
of classification and cataloguing. After this has been
accomplished it will be necessary to make these possessions
known to the teachers and pupils. This can only be done
by one who is familiar with the material and trained in
its use. If the reference work is done by an untrained
worker it is a case of the blind leading the blind. A teacher
with no training in library methods will not go to another
teacher, known to be similarly deficient, for information
in regard to books, and the pupils will get comparatively
little real library help from one who is primarily a class-room
teacher, untrained to meet all classes of readers and
answer a great variety of questions.</p>

<p class='c010' >The interested librarian will be on the lookout for any
new books that may be of use to teachers and pupils; she
will try to keep a balance in the matter of books for the
various departments of study, to inform herself on current
events and, in short, make herself as useful in all lines of
high school work as is possible with the time and means
at her disposal.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Assistance for the Librarian.</b>—As the work of the library
grows it will be necessary for the librarian to have assistance
of some kind. The arrangement for this will depend
largely upon the circumstances in the given school. In
many schools student assistants are employed. In some
cases boys are hired at a small sum per hour to give their
services as pages. In others good students are allowed
to volunteer for library work, giving one hour a day to it.
They enjoy the work and find their enlarged knowledge
of the library very useful. In some schools the librarian
is assisted by a member of the teaching staff, who thus
becomes familiar with the library and acquires some knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
of reference work and can assist the pupils in various
ways.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Purposes of a Library.</b>—The purposes of a school library
should be not only to provide laboratory material for the
pupils’ work in literature and history, to enable the teacher
to instruct them in the use of books as sources of information,
and to assist the teacher in other ways, but also to instil
in the pupils an interest in books as books, to cultivate
a taste for reading. Too many high school graduates have
no conception of a book, other than fiction, as anything
but a task or a text.</p>

<p class='c010' >The high school library should not try to compete with
the public library if there is one in the same town. Literature
for recreation pure and simple is better supplied by
the public library, where it is available for those who are
both below and above the high school age. But, on the
other hand, if there is nothing to interest the students by
its innate appeal, if everything in the school library suggests
lessons, many of the students will view it with suspicion,
and avoid it, unless sent there by the teachers.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Teaching the Use of the Library.</b>—Most pupils when
they enter the high school are ignorant of the use of the
simplest and most common reference books. They do not
know the difference between a table of contents and an
index, and are so helpless in a library that their teachers
hesitate to give them work outside their text-books. Even
those who are best informed can be helped to the use of
books which will be of the greatest assistance to them in
the preparation of their daily lessons, essays, and debates.</p>

<p class='c010' >Early in the school year the librarian ought to meet the
new students and explain to them in the reading-room the
grouping of the books and the fundamental principles underlying
the making of a dictionary card catalogue. The
location of various classes of reference books should be
pointed out, the differences between a dictionary and an
encyclopædia explained, and the various types of both
commented upon. The pupils should be shown how to
use “Poole’s Index” and the “Reader’s Guide to Periodical
Literature” and have the helpfulness of these aids clearly
brought home to them by concrete illustrations in connection
with some practical theme work or preparation for a
debate. If this initial visit to the library is made the subject
of a required paper in the English course the benefits
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
are doubled. The pupils can be assigned problems of
various kinds involving the intelligent use of tables of contents
and indexes, and familiarizing themselves with a
variety of reference books.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> They can be asked to fill out
a call slip from the reference in the card catalogue, take
the volume to the delivery desk, have it charged out, return
it, see it discharged and put back in its regular place on the
shelves.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Library Instruction.</b>—The library instruction, in order to
be of real benefit to the pupils, should be made a part of the
school curriculum and be given credit the same as other
work. In most schools where it is given it is counted as a
part of the English work. In the high schools of Michigan
the time given to the library work varies from one to three
exercises for each of the grades. The instruction is given
in the form of lectures or informal talks, after which the
pupils are required to work out a set of problems on reference
books. This work is done in the library under the supervision
of the librarian. The completed exercises are in
some schools handed in to the librarian and in others to
the English teacher, but the credit is usually given the
pupil by his English teacher. The talks are arranged to
suit the work and needs of the different classes. Those for
the ninth grade pupils ordinarily include instruction in the
use of dictionaries, encyclopædias and atlases, and the use
of the table of contents and indexes in reference books.
The instruction for the tenth grade takes up the use of the
card catalogue, magazine indexes, year-books, and special
indexes. The upper classes may be given practice work in
comparing the value of different reference books, in learning
to get references from various sources not on the reference
shelves, and in the use of some of the government publications.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Library Courses.</b>—One of the best library courses of this
kind is that conducted by the librarian of the Detroit
Central High School, where the work is graded to correspond
with the regular grading of the English courses in that
school. The librarian has a graded series of library questions
which are among the best illustrations of this kind of work
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
for high school courses available in print. We give specimens
from the various series as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
    <li><span style="display: block; padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">

</ol>

<p class='c010' >There is an almost endless variety of questions which can
be put to the students to bring out points in connection with
reference books. They can be asked to name the various
kinds of dictionaries in the library, to tell which is the latest
issue, to look up the same word in each, and tell the differences
noted in the treatment of the word in question. See
whether they can define a gazetteer, a glossary, and a concordance.
Ask them where they would go to find a picture
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
of the human skeleton, or colored plates of coats of arms
and flags of various nations. See whether the word copyright
means anything to them.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>The Teacher and the Library.</b>—“The position of a
modern librarian in a high school,” says Principal
McAndrew,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> of the Washington Irving High School,
New York, “seems to me like that of a missionary in
a heathen country. No one but a librarian can realize
what an astounding amount of ignorance we high school
teachers exhibit regarding the purpose and operation
of a library. Time and again in my library experience
I have observed teachers searching through reference books
who were too poorly trained to look in the table of contents
and too proud to ask for help.” A frank confession from
the teacher is good for the soul of both the teacher and the
librarian. Certainly the classroom teacher must inform
herself more thoroughly on the rudiments of library methods
if she is to work in successful co-operation with the school
librarian. Normal schools are now giving instruction in
library economy. The Oregon Library Commission has
published a broadside listing under forty-three heads, “Some
things a teacher should know about books and libraries.”
The list has been reprinted by the Michigan State Library
Commission with slight revision. As specimens the following
may be cited:</p>

<p class='c012' >1. What are the best cyclopedias?</p>

<p class='c012' >2. What dictionaries are best for school use and how do
they differ?</p>

<p class='c012' >3. What books can you consult to find out whether certain
subscription sets urged upon the district by
agents have any value?</p>

<p class='c012' >4. What is the best printed aid to the formation of a
teacher’s professional library?</p>

<p class='c012' >5. Where will you find annual summaries of the books on
education, with notes as to their value?</p>

<p class='c012' >6. What U. S. public documents would be of value to you
in your school work and how may they be obtained?</p>

<p class='c012' >7. What are the best printed lists of books for children
and how much will they cost?</p>

<p class='c012' >8. What are the best graded lists of children’s books?</p>

<p class='c012' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
9. Where can you get notes about children’s books that
will be of service in guiding the reading of the children
in your grade?</p>

<p class='c012' >10. What are the best books for reading aloud in your grade?</p>

<p class='c012' >11. What are the best collections of poetry for children?</p>

<p class='c012' >12. What books may be the best stepping-stones for the
boy who is a slave to the “nickel library” habit?</p>

<p class='c012' >13. What simple, accurate, scientific books will you give
to the boys who are, or may become, interested in
natural science; and what will you choose for those
who wish to identify specimens of insects, of minerals
and rocks, of birds, and of flowers?</p>

<p class='c012' >14. If you do not know about these books how will you inform
yourself?</p>

<p class='c012' >15. What are some of the best biographies for children?</p>

<p class='c012' >16. What are some of the good books of travel for use in
geography work?</p>

<p class='c012' >17. How can you find what magazine articles have been
written about any subject and how can you get
these articles for the use of the debating society?</p>

<p class='c012' >18. What are the best books for the debating society?</p>

<p class='c012' >19. What are the best periodicals for children?</p>

<p class='c012' >20. What are the provisions of the school library law in
regard to district-school libraries?</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Value of Library Instruction.</b>—Such library instruction as
has been described is of great help to teachers assigning
work to pupils and of the greatest benefit to the pupils
themselves. Without it, the librarian, teachers, and pupils
are handicapped in their work and the library fails of its
full usefulness. A knowledge of how to use a library will
be of the greatest value to the student not only through
his high school course, but even more so in college, if he
goes that far, or in continuing his reading and self-culture
through the means of the public library when he discontinues
his academic career. To be able to use books effectively,
to know where to find exact information when wanted, is
a kind of knowledge that comes from familiarity with
reference books and the use of books as sources. Such
an acquaintance with books is of infinitely more value in
later life than knowing a few text-books from cover to cover.
The place in which to lay the foundation for this proper and
intimate acquaintance with books as tools is in the school
library and the period is that of the high school age.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br /><b>SUGGESTED READINGS IN THE ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA.</b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009' >The new Encyclopædia Britannica will prove a rich
mine for the diligent library assistant seeking information
on topics connected with books and libraries. While the
index volume suggests some of the topics in question, much
of this suggestion is done by means of cross-references and
it is worth while to call special attention to and briefly
summarize the articles of interest to library workers. One
of the first things worthy of notice is the fact that the
articles are written by men who are recognized authorities in
their various fields; such scholars as Sir E. Maunde Thompson,
late chief librarian of the British Museum, Alfred W.
Pollard and Cyril Davenport, also of the British Museum,
H. R. Tedder, librarian of the Athenæum Club, and editor
of “<i>The Library</i>” and J. Duff Brown, librarian of the Islington
Public Libraries and author of the “Guide to librarianship”
and other valued treatises on library economy.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Manuscripts.</b>—Beginning with the <b>Manuscript</b> the student
can read in Sir E. Maunde Thompson’s article a description
of the development of the ancient manuscript,
particularly among the Greeks and Romans, leading on to
the mediaeval manuscripts of Europe, and bringing their
history down to the invention of printing. The writer
treats of the materials used, the forms of the manuscript
book (the roll, the waxen tablet, the codex, the quires) the
mechanical arrangement of writing, punctuation, division
of words, abbreviations and contractions, writing implements
and inks. Those who wish to pursue the subject
further can turn to the same writer’s article on <b>Palæography</b>,
the science which takes cognizance of writings of a
literary, economic or legal nature, done generally with a
stile, reed or pen, on tablets, rolls or codices. This paper
traces the history of Greek and Latin palæography from
the earliest written documents in those languages which
have survived, touching especially on Greek papyri and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
vellum codices, the Roman cursive and literary hands, and
the various national hands derived from the Roman hand.
It is therefore concerned with the fundamentals of the
written records of Western Europe. Manuscripts with
illustrations form a class by themselves and are described by
this same high authority under <b>Illuminated Mss.</b> Here
are outlined the chief features of the Byzantine, Franco-Lombardic,
Celtic (with special mention of the Lindisfarne
Gospels, of which a full-page colored facsimile is given)
Carolingian, Anglo-Saxon, Norman, German, Italian and
Spanish. There are separate paragraphs on the characteristics
of the illumination of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Paper.</b>—In the first section of the articles on Paper
Sir Maunde Thompson discusses various theories as to the
origin and early history of this commodity. For an account
of the writing material made from <b>Papyrus</b> the author
refers us to his treatment of that subject, where he gives
an account of the reed, its cultivation and wide-spread
use, its manipulation into the article of commerce and the
use of the latter by scribes. The second section of the
article on Paper treats especially of its manufacture and is
written by J. W. Wyatt, with an interesting supplementary
note on <b>India Paper</b> by W. E. G. Fisher. The name “India”
was “originally given in England, about the middle of the
18th century to a soft absorbent paper of a pale buff shade,
imported from China, where it was made by hand, on a
paper-making frame somewhat similar to that used in
Europe. The name probably originated in the prevailing
tendency, down to the end of the 18th century, to describe
as ‘Indian’ anything which came from the far East (<i>cf.</i>
Indian ink). This so-called India paper was used for
printing the earliest and finest impressions of engravings,
hence known as ‘India proofs’”.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>The Book.</b>—As pointed out by Alfred W. Pollard in his
article on the Book, there is but a slight difference in general
appearance between a manuscript written in a formal
book-hand and an early printed copy of the same work
printed in the same district as the manuscript had been
written. The type used by the early printers was as a rule
based on handwriting considered appropriate for use in a
manuscript copy of the same work. The development of
the colophon into the title-page (a subject on which Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
Pollard is an authority) is briefly summarized. Other
characteristics of some of the early printed books, such as
their size, their paper, their illustrations and their bindings
are noted. The main features of the books of each
century from the 16th to the 19th are succinctly characterized
in separate paragraphs, and the comparative cost
of books at various periods is illustrated by citations of
prices of well known works.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Incunabula.</b>—Another article by Mr. Pollard treats of
Incunabula. After summarizing the researches in this field
the author grants that it is literally true that the output
of the 15th century presses is better known to students
than that of any other period. The subject has been pursued
with what some have thought to be excessive and
misplaced zeal. American librarians are naturally not so
much interested in incunabula as are their European brethren,
but our larger libraries and especially our universities are
coming to have a fair representation of the work of some
of the early printers and one notable collection, that made
by Dr. Copinger, has come to this country, having been presented
to the Philadelphia Free Library by Mr. P. A. B.
Widener.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Printing.</b>—The article on Printing by C. T. Jacobi, the
author of a practical treatise on the subject which has gone
through four editions, is confined to the work of the printing
press and is divided into two parts: (1) history of the
printing press and (2) modern presses. Those who do
not have a mechanical bent will probably not get much
out of these sections, but towards the end of the article is
some general information on printing which ought to prove
of interest to every library assistant.</p>

<p class='c010' >The history of printing is treated at great length under
the caption of <b>Typography</b> by J. H. Hessels, author of
“Gutenberg; an historical investigation.” This article discusses
in turn the manuscript period, the earliest attempts
at printing, block-printing, early wood-engravings, block
books, early printing with movable type, the controversy
concerning the invention (this with great fulness), of early
types and their fabrication, and ends with a sketch of some
printers who flourished after 1500. A second section,
entitled <b>Modern Practical Typography</b>, in part by John
Southward, author of a “Dictionary of typography,” deals
with the material characteristics of type, the sizes, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
varieties of face, the manufacture of type, composition
and imposition, signatures and forms, typesetting machines,
electrotyping and stereotyping.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Proof Reading</b>, by John H. Black, who was press reader
on the new volumes of the 10th edition of the Britannica,
and John Randall, is of concern to all of us who have to do
with “the art preservative of all the arts.” Proof reading
seems to be practiced less and less in these days of type-setting
machines, but being informed on the subject will help us
in insisting on good work along this line.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Illustrations.</b>—That the information concerning zinc cuts,
half-tones, three color processes, monotypes, electrotypes,
photolithotypes, and all other photo-mechanical methods
of reproduction should be included in an article under
<b>Process</b> will probably strike American readers as a Briticism,—but
the facts are up to date and reliable. The
writer, Mr. Edwin Bale, art director for Cassell and Co.,
grants that the term “process” is a somewhat unfortunate,
one inasmuch as it is descriptive of nothing in particular.
The article discusses in turn the various classes under the
three generic heads: (1) <b>relief</b>, such as zinc etching, half-tones,
including those in color; (2) <b>intaglio</b>, such as photogravures
and monotypes, where, as in the old copper plates,
the printing surface is sunk below the surrounding portions
of the plate; (3) <b>planographic</b>, like lithographs, collotypes,
phototypes and heliotypes, which are all printed from flat
surfaces. The distinction between these various kinds of
illustrations is not easily grasped by the beginner, but no
one whose constant business is with books ought to be
ignorant of the difference between a woodcut and a half-tone,
a mezzotint and a chrome-lithograph, a copper plate
and a cleverly devised imitation made from a zinc block,
and yet I have seen a good many library school graduates
to whom the whole matter was so much Greek. How can
you buy illustrated books intelligently if you don’t know
whether the illustrations are what they pretend to be?
Better read up further in Mr. Frank Weitenkampf’s “How
to appreciate prints” and study carefully the Newark exhibit,
“The features of the printed book,” the first opportunity
you get. Meanwhile, make yourself familiar with
the general information given by Laurence Housman in
his article on <b>Illustration</b>. Leaving aside the illumination
of manuscripts, the art of illustration in its modern sense
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
goes back to the invention of printing. Many incunabula
were enriched with drawings by artists of the French,
German, Spanish and Italian schools. Many engravings
on both wood and copper by such men as Dürer and Holbein
were made to adorn the printed page. The art of illustration
has always been influenced by the prevailing pictorial art.
French engraving was influenced by the painting of Watteau.
English illustrations of different periods show the large
following which such men as Reynolds and Hogarth were
accorded. Bewick laid the foundations for a school of
English wood engraving which persisted until the invention
of mechanical methods of reproduction came into vogue.
The cheap magazines created a great demand for illustrations
that could be inexpensively produced, and the files
of illustrated periodicals thereby became one of the best
places in which to study the work of wood engravers and
illustrators whose work lent itself to reproduction in cheap
form. To those who know how to use them aright this
gives a new interest to some of the Poole sets which have
of late years been retired to out of the way places, such
as <i>Once a week</i>, <i>Good words</i>, <i>London Society</i>, <i>Sunday at
home</i>, for in the pages of these journals are found illustrations
by some of the best men of the school known as “of
the ’sixties.”</p>

<p class='c010' >The technical developments of the art of illustration
form the subject of a brief supplementary article by E. F.
Strange of the South Kensington Museum. This is concerned
with the history of experiments leading to the development
of the present day half-tone block and color
printing.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Bookbinding</b> is treated by Cyril Davenport, who sketches
the history of his subject from the earliest times when
protective covers were used over the smaller Assyrian
tablets of about the 8th century B. C., through the days
of Latin diptychs (the earliest prototypes of the modern
book) to the time of rolls of papyrus, vellum or paper. The
device of folding vellum into pages was first used about
the 5th century of the Christian era, and the sewing of
these signatures by fastening the threads around a strip
of leather or vellum at right angles to the line of backs was
the next stage in the development of the modern book.
Then it was found that the bands needed protection and
so strips of leather were fastened down the backs, and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
order to prevent the tendency of the vellum leaves to curl,
strong wooden boards were put on each side and the leather
back was drawn over the boards far enough to make a
hinge, thus giving us the half-bound books of the middle
ages. The next steps were to cover not only the back but
also the sides of the book with leather and then to decorate
the leather. The art of gold tooling spread quickly, and
heraldic designs were used for ornamentation from the
days of Edward VI. The deterioration of the quality of
modern book paper and badly prepared leathers have been
serious drawbacks to good bookbinding, but there has
been a revival of interest in the art for its own sake during
recent years. The introduction of stamped cloth binding
about 1822 developed into the case binding of today, for
which elaborate machinery has been perfected.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Book-plates</b> are thought of by many librarians as being
unworthy of their serious attention, but a mere glance at
the article by Egerton Castle should convince the uninitiated
as to the value of at least a rudimentary knowledge of the
subject. Mr. Castle’s study of “English book-plates”
appeared twenty years ago, but his interest in ex-libris
has apparently not flagged despite the demands of novel
writing on his time, which is a tribute to the fascinations
of these little marks of ownership. Among the illustrations
are reproduced the earliest known movable book-plate, one
belonging to the monastery of Buxheim, dating from about
1480, and the oldest English plate, that of Sir Nicholas
Bacon, 1574. Good examples are given of armorial plates
of various periods, of the Jacobean, the Chippendale or
rococo, and the pictorial where, as in the Bewick plate,
the motif is a bit of landscape or, as in the plate by E. D.
French, a library interior.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Bookselling.</b>—Even those librarians who think that they
know something about buying books, can with decided
advantage read the article on Bookselling. The modern
system goes back almost to the invention of printing. The
earliest printers were also editors and booksellers but as they
were not able themselves to dispose of the entire output of
their presses they had agents at most of the universities.
The religious dissensions following the Reformation created
a great demand for books and there were troublous times
for both printers and booksellers. In the English copyright
act of 1709 it is ruled that if any person shall think
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
the published price of a book unreasonably high he may
make complaint to the archbishop of Canterbury and to
certain other persons named who shall thereupon examine
into his complaint and if well founded reduce the price,
and any bookseller charging more than the price agreed
upon shall be fined for every copy sold. Unfortunately
this law was never enforced. Were there such a court of
appeal today it would have a full docket! In the paragraph
on bookselling in this country it is pointed out that half
the names in the “so-called American catalogue of books”
printed between 1820 and 1852 are British, the works of
Scott, Byron, Moore, Southey and Wordsworth having
been printed here without the payment of any royalties.
Through the growth of intercourse with England and the
appearance on the literary horizon of native writers of
ability, a decided change was gradually produced in the
American book trade and the conditions here became more
like those of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Publishing.</b>—The subject of bookselling is treated still
further in the article on Publishing which is in a way a
continuation of it. It gives more historical detail concerning
the early stages of this once combined business,
with a good deal on that topic of interest to librarians and
the book-buying public,—the net price question. The early
separation of publishing from bookselling is touched upon,
and the emergence of publishers as a separate class is outlined.
The transitory phenomenon of the man of letters
assisting the publisher in an advisory capacity as to the
suitability of manuscripts submitted for publication is an
interesting chapter in the expansion of the publishing
business. Publishing being today largely a commercial
affair, the literary reader has in the main been supplanted
by the man of business with an aptitude for estimating
how many copies of a given book can be sold. One London
publisher has of recent years paid no salary to his reader
but has given him a small commission upon every copy
that was sold of any book published on his recommendation.
What is wanted by the publisher is only too often not
literary quality but commercial value.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Bibliography.</b>—The article on this subject by Mr. Pollard,
is only concerned with bibliography as the art of examination,
collation and description of books,—their enumeration
and arrangement in lists for purposes of information, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
further, with the literature of this subject, <i>i. e.</i> with the
bibliography of bibliography. The examination and collation
of books to discover whether they are perfect and in
their original condition are especially important in the
case of rare books, like incunabula and first editions, piracies
and spurious imprints. Photographic forgeries of books
can usually be detected by the tendency of all photographic
reproduction to thicken letters and exaggerate every kind
of defect. Some of these imitations are, however, very
cleverly made on paper of the period of the original and so
are very hard to distinguish from the latter.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Book Collecting</b> is sympathetically discussed by Mr.
Pollard. The statement that the ultimate rarity of books
varies in the inverse ratio of the number of copies originally
printed, though recognized as a somewhat sweeping generalization,
is conceded to be not far from the truth. No one
thinks of collecting what is easily procurable at the moment.
So long as the anticipation exists that a book will continue
to be easily procurable the collecting impulse is restrained.
Book collecting as a hobby is analyzed and the history of
some notable private collections given. As Thomas Watts
once said, the main office of private collections is to feed
public institutions.</p>

<p class='c010' ><b>Libraries.</b>—This brings us to the article on Libraries,
written jointly by H. R. Tedder and J. Duff Brown, an
article of about 65,000 words and deserving of more than
a passing notice. It is the latest conspectus of library
history and activity and if printed separately might have
made a book of several hundred pages which would have
been duly reviewed in all the professional journals. The
fact that it is in the Britannica insures it even wider publicity
and in view of its excellence we feel that it is worth
while calling to the particular attention of librarians.</p>

<p class='c010' >The general treatment divides the subject into Ancient
libraries (3 pages) Mediaeval period (3 pages) and Modern
libraries (26 pages). The first section has an archaeological
rather than a professional interest, but the mediaeval period
is of importance to us because in it is found the real origin
of modern library organization. A rule of St. Benedict
required the monks to borrow a book apiece and read it
straight through. The books in the Benedictine monastery
were kept in <i>armaria</i>, or chests; whence the name
of the Benedictine librarian, <i>armarius</i>. The Carthusians
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
are supposed to have been the first to lend books for
use outside the monastery. The library at Cesena in
Northern Italy is still preserved in its original condition.
The Laurentian library at Florence was designed after
monastic models.</p>

<p class='c010' >The development of modern libraries is first illustrated
by examples from the United Kingdom, by sketching the
history of the British Museum, and other English Government
libraries, by outlining the growth of the university
libraries of Great Britain, incidentally touching on the
libraries of learned societies, clubs, municipalities, and
winding up with a section on British library administration.
All this is admirably done, and deserves careful reading.
The authors suggest several reforms and question some
practices. For example, they feel that it would be an
advantage from an administrative standpoint if the professional
certificates of the Library Association were adopted
by the Civil Service Commissioners as a compulsory requirement
in addition to their own examination. They evidently
favor some form of “registration,” the mooted topic before
the British Library Association. The official recognition
of a grade of properly trained librarians would in the opinion
of these writers tend to improve the methods and efficiency
of the government libraries, generally conceded to be behind
the municipal libraries in organization and administration.
It is pointed out that the reading of fiction in British municipal
libraries is much less than commonly believed, being
only 24 percent, even after due allowance is made for the
reading of fiction in current magazines. Attention is called
to the gradual disappearance of the unclassified municipal
library, although in 1910 there were over 340 not closely
classified, but only arranged in broad numerical or alphabetical
divisions. The replacement of printed catalogs in
book form by card catalogs and other forms, like the sheaf
catalog, easily kept up to date, is noted as growing in favor.
The great increase in the freedom of access allowed in lending
libraries is considered the most striking tendency of recent
years.</p>

<p class='c010' >In the section devoted to the United States, the Library
of Congress naturally comes first, and is characterized as
“the most active government library in existence.” The
rise of the state and university libraries is sketched, and
something is said about the proprietary and endowed libraries
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
of the country. That these writers are not of the
group who have been saying unkind things about us, witness
the following: “In no country has the movement for the development
of municipal libraries made such progress as in the
United States; these institutions ... are distinguished for their
work, enterprise and the liberality with which they are supported.”
There is an interesting comparison of the cost of
maintenance of English and American libraries. East Orange,
N. J. (population 35,000) spends $12,000 on its library
system, while Dumfries in Scotland (population 23,000)
spends $2,500. The city of Cincinnati, with practically
the same population as the borough of Islington, London,
spends more than three times as much money on its library
system,—$130,000 as contrasted with $41,000. It would
be instructive to compare the work done in these particular
cities. The general statement is made that the provision
of books is more generous in the American libraries than
in those of Great Britain, but that more reading is done in
the latter. The authors point out that work with the
schools and children generally is more cultivated in the
libraries of the United States than elsewhere. They are
cautious in their statements, but one can read the doubt
in their minds as to the wisdom of the “story hour” in the
library. “The preponderance of women librarians and
their natural sentimental regard for children has tended
to make this work loom rather largely in some quarters,
but with these exceptions the activity on behalf of children
is justified on many grounds. But above all, it is manifest
that a rapidly growing nation, finding homes for thousands
of foreigners and their children annually, must use every
means of rapidly educating their new citizens, and the
public library is one of the most efficient and ready ways
of accomplishing this great national object.”</p>

<p class='c010' >While the remainder of the article, devoted to libraries
in non-English speaking countries, is of less immediate
interest to the average library assistant, it should be read
with care for the perspective it will help to give. We
should know more of our historical background and here is an
excellent place to get a bird’s eye view of the whole library
movement. The account of the Bibliothèque Nationale
and other libraries of Paris, is very complete and contains
references and statistics not generally available. The description
of the Berlin libraries is less full, but satisfactory.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
The Italian libraries come in for their share of attention,
and the article ends with accounts of the library movement
and the noteworthy libraries in Latin America, Spain and
Portugal, the Netherlands, Russia, China and Japan. The
article as a whole will bear reading several times and can
be consulted constantly with full-reliance upon its detailed
information.</p>

<p class='c010' >In addition to the above there are articles which have
a special interest for different classes of library workers.
The cataloger will want to read what is said on the <b>Index</b>,
where a high compliment is paid “American enterprise”
for the modern device of the card catalog cabinet, and the
Library of Congress for its printed card work. The assistant
in the periodical room ought to read the article on
<b>Periodicals</b> by Mr. Tedder, which deals chiefly with publications
devoted to general literature, literary and critical
reviews, and magazines for the supply of miscellaneous
reading. It takes up in historical sequence the British
quarterlies, monthlies, weeklies, modern magazines and
cheap publications; then those of the United States, Canada
and other British possessions, France, Germany, Austria,
Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Portugal, Greece, Russia and other countries.
Under the caption of <b>Caricature</b> Mr. M. H. Spielman
writes entertainingly concerning the popular illustrated
periodicals of Great Britain, France, Germany and the
United States. In the latter section he sketches the rise
of Thomas Nast, discusses the influence of <i>Life</i>, and the
work of C. D. Gibson and A. B. Frost. In his paragraph
on <b>Cartoon</b> Mr. Spielman says that John Leech’s drawing
in No. 105 of <i>Punch</i> was the first caricature to be called a
“cartoon.” After a while <i>Punch</i> dropped the latter word
but the public took it up. The information concerning
<b>Newspapers</b> has been garnered by several hands. Mr.
Hugh Chisholm, the editor of the present edition of the
Britannica, and for some years connected with the London
<i>Times</i>, writes the first installment entitled “General considerations”
giving the historical development of the newspaper
(particularly the English) from the Oxford Gazette
of 1665, through the days of the “leading article” by prominent
writers, down to the time of the “news agencies.”
The present status of journalism, with its well developed
commercial side, is passed in review, and the influence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
American journalism is duly set forth. The cheapening
of paper, which within one generation dropped from 22
cents to as low as 1-1/2 cents a pound, is shown to have had
the obvious tendency of increasing the size of newspapers
and reducing the price. The attitude of some English
newspaper publishers towards news of the turf is instructive
to American librarians who have read of the “blocking
out” of sporting tips deemed necessary in some English
libraries. The simultaneous growth of the cheap newspaper
throughout the civilized world is commented upon by
Lord Northcote in two interpolated paragraphs, which are
followed by some remarks on <b>Illustrated Papers</b> by Mr.
Clement K. Shorter. The remainder of the article by Mr.
Chisholm consists of a very full account of British newspapers
(in which certain portions of the article by Edward
Edwards, of library fame, in the earlier edition of the Britannica,
have been incorporated) followed by an historical
sketch of those of the United States, of France, Germany
and other European countries.</p>

<p class='c010' >Much of the information presented by Prof. E. G. Ravenstein
under the caption <b>Map</b> is of immediate interest to all
of us. It treats in turn of the classification and scale of
maps, delineation of the ground, selection of names and
orthography, measurement on maps, relief maps, map
printing, history of cartography, and topographical surveys.
The reading of what Mr. H. R. Tedder has to say on <b>Pamphlets</b>
may make the library assistant who has to handle
them more kindly disposed toward this class of publications.
There is nothing like knowing the history of a subject to
incite interest in it.</p>

<p class='c010' >The bibliographies appended to each article will enable
the inquiring and ambitious assistant to pursue further
such phases of the questions involved as may make the
stronger appeal; but the source of the greatest satisfaction
is that the workers in the smaller libraries, where but little
of the literature of librarianship is to be found, can find
within the covers of the Encyclopædia Britannica a conspectus
of authoritative statements on many matters of
professional interest.</p>
